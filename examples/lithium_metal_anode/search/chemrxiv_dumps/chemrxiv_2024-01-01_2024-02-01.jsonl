It enables the use of various descriptors and ML frameworks for regression and classification tasks in an automated, flexible, and accessible manner through Jupyter Notebooks,  making it easy to customize for specific tasks.  We showcase the capabilities and versatility of PythiaCHEM in two distinct chemistry tasks: first, the evaluation of the transmembrane chloride anion transport activity of synthetic anion transporters, and second, the prediction of enantioselectivity in the Strecker synthesis of a-amino acids.

However, our knowledge of the complex effects of doping and surface modification that govern the PEC performance is still underdeveloped, which makes the rational design of high-performance BiVO4-based photoanodes challenging. Herein, a remarkably effective strategy for enhancing the performance of BiVO4 photoanodes by combining the bulk doping of BiVO4 with molybdenum (Mo) and its surface modification with a well-defined molecular cobalt polyoxometalate water oxidation catalyst (CoPOM = Na10[Co4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2]) via a simple impregnation protocol without any linkers or binders is reported. The best-performing optimized Mo-BiVO4/CoPOM photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 4.32 mA cm\u22122 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G (1 sun) illumination and an applied-bias photoconversion efficiency (ABPE) of ~0.73%, which is an improvement by the factor of ~24 with respect to pristine BiVO4. The respective contributions of the Mo-doping and modification with CoPOM to the performance enhancement are disentangled based on detailed mechanistic investigations. The positive effect of Mo-doping is shown to be related to enhanced electronic conductivity and passivation of surface states, whereby these beneficial effects are operative only at relatively high applied bias potentials (> 0.9 V vs. RHE), and at lower bias potentials (< 0.7 V vs. RHE) they are counterbalanced by strongly detrimental effects related to increased concentration of electron polaronic states induced by the Mo-doping. The highly beneficial effect of CoPOM deposition is unambiguously demonstrated to be related to the enhancement of water oxidation catalysis. Notably, the molecular CoPOM acts as a pre-catalyst, as it undergoes (at least partially) conversion to cobalt oxide under the PEC operating conditions. Our work thus establishes CoPOM-derived catalysts as effective water oxidation catalysts at BiVO4 photoanodes, and suggests that further progress in BiVO4 photoanode development depends critically on devising alternative strategies for conductivity enhancement that would avoid the negative polaronic effects associated with the conventional bulk doping of BiVO4.", "date": "2024-01-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Photocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Unfortunately, the structural and biophysical mechanisms of several key MLGIs remain poorly understood, limiting our ability to design spatially matched glycoconjugates as potent therapeutics against targeting MLGIs. A synthetic pseudo-dimannose (psDiMan) ligand has been shown to selectively bind to a dendritic cell surface tetrameric lectin, DC-SIGN, over some other multimeric lectins sharing monovalent mannose specificity but having distinct cellular functions. Herein, we dis-play psDiMan polyvalently onto gold nanoparticles (GNP-psDiMan) to probe how scaffold size and glycan valency control their multivalent binding properties with DC-SIGN. We reveal that GNP-psDiMan binds strongly, with sub-nM Kds, to DC-SIGN and their binding affinity is enhanced with the increasing GNP scaffold size. Interestingly, there is a minimal, GNP size-dependent, glycan density threshold for forming strong MLGIs with DC-SIGN. Moreover, we have developed a new fluores-cence quenching method for probing MLGI thermodynamics by quantifying MLGI affinities under varying temperatures in combination with the Van\u2019t Hoff analysis. We reveal that DC-SIGN binding with GNP-psDiMans is enthalpy driven, with the standard binding enthalpy changes (DH0s) of ~ -100 kJ/mol, matching well to those measured by isothermal titration calo-rimetry. Such DH0 values are ~4 folds that of the corresponding monovalent psDiMan-DC-SIGN binding, implying that all 4 binding sites in DC-SIGN are engaged in binding to GNP-psDiMan. Dynamic light scattering studies further show that DC-SIGN binds glycans from the same GNP-psDiMan. Finally, using particles pseudotyped with the Ebola virus glycoprotein, we show that GNP-psDiMans potently inhibit DC-SIGN-dependent augmentation of Ebola virus cellular entry with sub-nM level EC50 values. Interestingly, such EC50 values are comparable to their DC-SIGN binding affinities measured by fluorescence quenching in solution. These results indicate that GNP based fluorescence quenching is a versatile method to reveal MLGI thermodynamics and binding determinants of high affinity MLGI interactions, and to predict GNP-glycan antiviral properties.\n", "date": "2024-01-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Biophysics; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The sensitivity of PL-Pb enables straightforward detection of trace amounts of GSR from ricochet markings, bullet holes and combustion plumes. We show that GSR is transferable with high spatial resolution and preservation of fine details such as the polygonal patterns caused by the rifling of the pistol.

Coarse-grained models offer a simplified representation of molecular systems, that in theory enables efficient simulations of large-scale system. Over the last decade, there has been a considerable increase in the adoption of coarse-grained models for simulations of biomolecular systems. Therefore, critical and independent evaluation of such models is warranted. Here, the properties of crystals of amyloid peptides as well as organic molecules are evaluated using the Martini coarse-grained force field. We investigate whether this force field can accurately maintain the crystal structure of amyloid peptides and organic compounds and predict melting temperatures. The peptide crystals change shape in the simulations, in most cases drastically so. Radial distribution functions show that the distance between backbone beads representing intermolecular hydrogen bonds in \u03b2-sheets increases by about 1 \u030aA in the simulation, breaking the crystals. In addition, the melting points of organic compounds are much lower in the Martini force field than in either an all-atom force field or experiment. Radial distribution functions for pyridine and phenol at 5 K show that the crystals transition into a glassy state when using Martini. Our results suggest that the Martini 3 model lacks the necessary level of specific interactions to accurately simulate peptide crystals or organic crystals without imposing artificial restraints. We speculate that the problems are exacerbated by the use of the 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential and suggest that a different, softer, potential could prove advantageous in harnessing this model for crystal simulations.", "date": "2024-01-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Solid-state NMR spectroscopy is then used to study the uptake of the lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide (LiTFSI) aqueous electrolyte in this activated carbon across the full pH range. Analysis of the NMR data shows the importance of including the fast ion-exchange processes involving ions moving in and out of the carbon pores to obtain a more accurate quantification of the adsorbed ions.

The code can include only the integers 0, 1 and 2, and in principle it can represent a number in any base b, higher than 2 (i.e. it cannot be a binary number).

The cell is fabricated using stereolithography 3D printing and the BDD particles are located at either end of a solution excluded central channel. Platinum wire electrodes placed in each of the two outer solution compartments are used to drive electrochemical reactions at the two BDD particles, which, under bipolar conditions do not require direct electrical connection to a potential source.

Monitoring of the time dependant change in MB peak area, from the UHPLC chromatograms, enables a pseudo first order rate constant of 0.54 min-1 to be determined for MB removal.

Typically, the most efficient polycationic vehicles also tend to be the most toxic. For lipophilic polycations\u2014which recruit hydrophobic interactions in addition to electrostatic interactions to bind and deliver nucleic acids\u2014extensive chemical or architectural modifications sometimes fail to resolve intractable toxicity-efficiency tradeoffs. Here, we demonstrate a facile post-synthetic polyplex surface modification strategy wherein with poly(L-glutamic acid) (PGA) rescues toxicity, inhibits hemolysis, and prevents serum inhibition of lipophilic polycation-mediated plasmid (pDNA) delivery. Importantly, the sequence in which polycations, pDNA, and PGA are combined dictates pDNA conformations and spatial distribution. Circular dichroism spectroscopy reveals that PGA must be added last to polyplexes assembled from lipophilic polycations and pDNA; else, PGA will disrupt polycation-mediated pDNA condensation. Although PGA did not mitigate toxicity caused by hydrophilic PEI-based polycations, PGA tripled the population of transfected viable cells for lipophilic polycations. Non-specific adsorption of serum proteins abrogated pDNA delivery mediated by lipophilic polycations; however, PGA-coated polyplexes proved more serum-tolerant than uncoated polyplexes. Despite lower cellular uptake than uncoated polyplexes, PGA-coated polyplexes were imported into nuclei at higher rates. PGA  also silenced the hemolytic activity of lipophilic polycations.

Glover", "abstract": "We recently introduced a polarizable embedding scheme based on an integral-exact reformulation of the direct reaction field method (IEDRF) that accounts for differential solvation of ground and excited states in QM/MM simulations. The polarization and dispersion interactions between the quantum-mechanical (QM) and molecular-mechanical (MM) regions are described by the DRF Hamiltonian, while the Pauli repulsion between explicitly treated QM electrons and the implicit electron density around MM atoms is modeled with effective core potentials. A single Hamiltonian is used for all electronic states, so that Born-Oppenheimer states belonging to the same geometry are orthogonal and state crossings are well-defined. In this work, we describe the implementation of the method using graphical processing unit acceleration in TeraChem, where it is combined with multiple electronic structure methods, including Hartree-Fock, Time-dependent Density Functional Theory, and Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field. In contrast with older implementations of the DRF method, integrals of the polarization operators are evaluated exactly. Expressions for ingredients needed to construct analytical gradients and non-adiabatic coupling vectors are derived and tested by optimizing a conical intersection between two excited states in the presence of a polarizable solvent shell. The method is applied to estimating the solvent shifts of absorption energies of a series of donor-acceptor dyes having low-lying charge-transfer states. Even for a non-polar solvent such as n-hexane, the inclusion of its static polarizability leads to non-negligible shifts that improve the agreement to essentially quantitative levels (0.03 eV) with full-system calculations. Good agreement with the positions of experimental absorption maxima measured in solution is also observed.

The choice of force field (FF) can significantly alter the MD results as the simulated local electrostatic interactions lack benchmarking in the absence of appropriate experimental methods. We recently reported that the transition dipole moment (TDM) of the popular nitrile vibrational probe varies linearly with the environmental electric field, overcoming well-known hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) issues for the nitrile frequency and, thus, enabling the unambiguous measurement of electric fields in proteins (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2022, 144 (17), 7562-7567). Herein, we utilize this new strategy to enable comparisons of experimental and simulated electric fields in protein environments. Specifically, previously determined TDM electric fields exerted onto nitrile-containing o-cyanophenylalanine residues in photoactive yellow protein are compared with MD electric fields from the fixed-charge AMBER FF and the polarizable AMOEBA FF. We observe that the electric field distributions for H-bonding nitriles are substantially affected by the choice of FF. As such, AMBER underestimates electric fields for nitriles experiencing moderate field strengths; in contrast, AMOEBA robustly recapitulates the TDM electric fields. The FF dependence of the electric fields can be partly explained by the presence of additional negative charge density along the nitrile bond axis in AMOEBA, which is due to the inclusion of higher-order multipole parameters; this in turn begets more head-on nitrile H-bonds. We conclude by discussing the implications of the FF dependence for the simulation of nitriles and proteins in general.

Towards this goal, several metal-catalyzed post-functionalization of polymers have been reported, with variable success, mostly on account of lack of selectivity, use of harsh reaction conditions, and use of environmentally unfriendly solvents. In this work, we demonstrate selective hydroxylation of the backbone 3\u00b0 C-H bonds in polyolefin macromolecules using in-house developed (Et4N)2[FeIII-(Ph,Me-bTAML)] (3) complex and solid Na2CO3.1.5 H2O2 (SPC; Sodium percarbonate) under solvent-free mechanochemical conditions. The reaction condition only employs simple mechanochemical grinding at room tempera-ture. The polar functional group -OH was successfully incorporated into the polymer backbone without any chain degradation and crosslinking. The same reaction conditions were also employed to selectively hydroxylate small organic molecules including com-plex natural products. The rate and selectivity of the reaction towards 3\u00b0 C-H bonds far exceed that performed under homogene-ous conditions. Mechanistic investigation indicates the formation of the well-characterized oxoiron(V) intermediate upon mechani-cal grinding of 3 and SPC. The high selectivity observed under solvent-free conditions is due to the elimination of solvent-induced side-reaction of this intermediate. This represents a very sustainable process since it uses environmentally benign reagents (iron complex, \u201coxygen bleach\u201d), thus eliminating the use of hazardous solvents. The workup protocol involves simple washing with water where both the spent catalyst and the oxidant are soluble.

Each of the above-mentioned molecules was conjugated to the AuNPs separately as well as simultaneously, loading efficiency of each cargo was assessed, and performance of the final product (FP) was assessed. After tumor induction in BALB/c mice, sub-IC50 doses of FP as well as control AuNPs, PTX, and PBS were administered in vivo. Round AuNPs were prepared using Fusarium oxysporum and exhibited size of 13 \u00b1 1.3 nm and zeta potential of -35.8 \u00b1 1.3 mV. The cytotoxicity of individual conjugates and FP were tested by MTT assay in breast tumor cells 4T1 and non-tumor fibroblasts NIH/3T3 cells. The conjugation of the individual molecules with AuNPs was confirmed and FP (size of 54 \u00b1 14 nm and zeta potential of -31.9 \u00b1 2.08 mV) showed higher 4T1-specific toxicity in vitro when compared to control conjugates. After in vivo application of the FP, TEM analyses proved presence of AuNPs in the tumor cells. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the tumor tissue revealed that the FP group exhibited the highest amounts of inflammatory, necrotic, and apoptotic cells in contrast to control groups. Finally, qPCR results showed that FP could transfect and suppress miR-135b expression in vivo, confirming the tumor-targeting properties of FP.

Our previous mechanistic efforts have suggested that while the electron-withdrawing carbonyls of the phthalimide are necessary to maximize the O-H bond dissociation enthalpy of the HAT product hydroxylamine and thus overall reaction thermodynamics, they can undergo nucleophilic substitution leading to catalyst decomposition. In an attempt to minimize this vulnerability, this work replaces the aryl ring in PINO with the combination of a substituted heteroatom and quaternary carbon.

This phenomenon, known as molecular glue induced protein degradation, has emerged as an innovative therapeutic approach in contrast to traditional small-molecule drugs.

We discuss all 43 synthetic products and point out four common shortfalls in the analysis. These errors unfortunately lead to the conclusion that no new materials have been discovered in that work.  We conclude that there are two important points of improvement that require future work from the community: (i) automated Rietveld analysis of powder x-ray diffraction data is not yet reliable. Future improvement of such, and the development of a reliable artificial intelligence-based tool for Rietveld fitting, would be very helpful, not only to autonomous materials discovery, but also the community in general. (ii) We find that disorder in materials is often neglected in predictions. The predicted compounds investigated herein have all their elemental components located on distinct crystallographic positions, but in reality, elements can share crystallographic sites, resulting in higher symmetry space groups and - very often - known alloys or solid solutions. This error might be related to the difficulty of modeling disorder in a computationally economical way, and needs to be addressed both by computational and experimental material scientists. We find that two-thirds of the claimed successful materials in Szymanski et al are likely to be known, compositionally disordered versions of the predicted, ordered compounds. We highlight important issues in materials discovery, computational chemistry, and autonomous interpretation of x-ray diffraction. We discuss concepts of materials discovery from an experimentalist point of view, which we hope will be helpful for the community to further advance this important new aspect of our field.

The fluorogenic RNA-binding dye QuantiFluor\u00ae (Promega) was found to be well-suited for direct and sensitive microscopic observation of vRNPs which facilitated background-free detection and kinetic analysis of fusion events on a single particle level. To determine the extent to which the viral contents are transferred to the target vesicles through the fusion pore, we carried out virus-vesicle fusion in a side-by-side fashion. Measurement of the Euclidean distances between the centroids of super-localized membrane and content dye signals within the fused volumes allowed determination of any symmetry (or the lack thereof) between them as expected in the event of transfer (or the lack thereof) of vRNPs, respectively. We found that in case of fusion between viruses and 100 nm target vesicles, ~39% of the events led to transfer of viral contents to the target vesicles.

In particular we show, using a zero-gap cell (ZGC) arrangement, how systematically increasing sp2 carbon results in an increase in ozone concentration and current efficiency. sp2 carbon addition is made using nanosecond pulse laser micromachining which converts the BDD to sp2 carbon. Two ZGC geometries are investigated which incorporate a Nafion membrane sandwiched between two BDD electrodes, with through-holes integrated into either the membrane or the BDD. Holes in the BDD are generated using laser micromachining which also converts the hole walls to sp2 carbon. Increasing the number of through-holes (or changing hole geometry) increases the sp2 carbon content of the electrode (from 5-100%). For the planar electrode, the proportion of the surface which is laser micromachined controls the sp2 carbon content (from 4-100%). This approach enables significantly higher sp2 carbon contents than is possible using diamond growth. sp2 carbon contents >40% and >60% for the planar and perforated BDD electrodes, respectively, are found to be particularly effective, allowing electrode designs to be proposed for optimised ZGC ozone generation. The sp2 carbon introduced during laser micromachining is shown to be extremely stable over 20 hr (anode potential ~ 10 V) in contrast to glassy carbon, which corrodes within 10 mins.

To address this, we introduce an innovative approach to photochemical reactor setup characterization, starting with radiometric light source analysis and progressing to a 3D reactor simulation for photon flux determination. Contrary to conventional techniques that prioritize complete photon absorption, our technique operates optimally when the reaction mixture is unsaturated. This strategy decouples photon flux and path length determination, substantially curtailing the experimental process. The workflow proves versatile across various reactor systems, simplifying intricate light interactions into a single one-dimensional parameter, i.e., the effective optical path length. Combined with the photon flux, this parameter effectively characterizes photochemical setups, irrespective of scale, geometry, light intensity, or photocatalyst concentration. Employing radiometry further offers insights into light source positioning and reactor design, and obviates the need for repeated chemical actinometry measurements due to light source degradation.

Standard BI provides estimation of parameter values, uncertainties, and correlations among parameters.  Used for ``model selection,'' BI can also distinguish between model structures, such as the presence or absence of individual states and transitions.  Fortunately for physical scientists, BI can be formulated within a statistical mechanics framework and indeed BI has led to a resurgence of interest in Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms, many of which have been directly adapted from or inspired by physical strategies.

As our continuous efforts in advancing gene doping control, in this work we have developed for the first time a sensitive and definitive PCR-liquid chromatography high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (PCR-LC-HRMS/MS) method for transgene detection, thus achieving an estimated limit of detection below 100 copies/mL for human erythropoietin (hEPO) transgene in equine plasma.

The resulting DNA fragments were then analysed by LC-HRMS/MS.  The applicability of this method has been demonstrated by successful detection of hEPO transgene in blood samples collected from a gelding that had been administered with hEPO.

A commonly observed phenomenon is partial saturation, i.e., regions of the paper membrane not being filled completely due to pores of different sizes. The most comprehensive model till date of partial saturation during wicking flow in paper is the Richard\u2019s equation. However, the nonlinear nature of this equation and the requirement for numerical solvers for its solution make it largely inaccessible to the paper microfluidics and lateral flow assay community. Moreover, the parameters used in Richard\u2019s equation often need to be tweaked (or assumed) to match experimental data. This necessitates the need for a simple and appropriate model of partial saturation in paper membranes, easily usable by the wider research community. In the current work, we present an approach to model paper membranes as a bundle of parallel capillaries whose radii follow a two parameter log normal distribution. Application of the Washburn equation to the bundle provides a distribution of fluid fronts, which can be used to calculate saturation. Using this approach, we developed the first analytical expression for spatiotemporal variation of saturation in 1D wicking flow. Experimentally obtained data for spatiotemporal saturation for four different paper materials were fit to this analytical model to obtain parameters for each material. Results obtained from this analytical model match both experimental data as well as numerical results obtained from the Richards equation model well.

Herein, we disclose the development of a Cu-catalyzed C\u2013O coupling method utilizing a new N1,N2-diarylbenzene-1,2-diamine ligand, L8.  Under optimized reaction conditions, a structurally diverse set of aryl and heteroaryl bromides underwent efficient coupling with a variety of alcohols at room temperature using an L8-based catalyst. Notably, the L8-derived catalyst exhibited enhanced activity when compared to the L4-based system previously disclosed for C\u2013N coupling, most notably including the ability to functionalize aryl bromides containing acidic functional groups. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that C\u2013O coupling utilizing the catalyst derived from L8 involves rate-limiting alkoxide transmetallation, resulting in a mechanism of C\u2013O bond formation that is distinct from previously described Pd-, Cu-, or Ni-based systems. Consequently, this lower energy pathway leads to rapid C\u2013O bond formation; a 7-fold increase relative to what it seen with other ligands.

Our simulations reveal that Sb2Si2Te6 exhibits superior electrical conductivity compared to Sc2Si2Te6 due to lower scattering rates and more pronounced band dispersion.

However, the QD nanobeads currently used in LFA still have drawbacks such as large particle size, which leads to high background, easy aggregation, and poor fluidity. To address these issues, a promising strategy is to utilize plasmonic energy transfer from gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to QDs in order to create smaller size and brighter fluorescent QD nanobeads, without simply increasing the amount of QDs encapsulated in the nanobeads. In this study, we prepared the plasmon-enhanced quantum dot nano-beads (PEQNB) by encapsulating AuNPs and QDs into polymer nanobeads using the versatile emulsion-solvent evapora-tion method. We were able to detect as low as ~4347 PEQNBs nanoparticles using a gel imager, which is 14.6 times brighter than the QD nanobeads of a similar size. Compared to QD nanobeads of similar size, the PEQNB-based LFA for interleukin-6 detection exhibited higher fluorescent signal and lower background.

Plum; Zachary R. Adam", "abstract": "The origins of genetic information processing remain a mystery in prebiotic chemistry research. Genetic systems encode information as digital sequences of nucleotide residues and require multiple interdependent and complex components that were likely to have been established late in the prebiotic evolutionary process. Candidate predecessor systems are potentially insightful for examining how genetic systems could have been scaffolded by alternatives that were simpler, yet capable of performing comparable functions. Some researchers have proposed that relative concentrations of simple chemical species (i.e., chemical compositions) could encode heritable information in an analog manner. While conceptually plausible, it is difficult to explain how most forms of analog inheritance (which can be highly sensitive to interference) could underpin emergent characteristics that are necessary for adaptive evolution afforded by high-fidelity, polymer-based digital inheritance. Here, by simulating bistable reaction systems with two simple autocatalytic cycles in lattices of connected flow reactors, we show that without linear polymers, it is still possible to encode spatial configurations of discrete states of chemical compositions that are heritable and mutable. Different configurations can have differing likelihoods of propagating to new environments, which means that they can respond to at least some types of selective processes. Taken together, these spatial configurations are heritable, mutable, and selectable (HMS). They are similar to analog inheritance because they depend on chemical compositions, and they are similar to digital inheritance because they consist of spatially distributed, discretized units. Although such discrete HMS spatial configurations are far less heritable, more mutable, and less selectable than nucleotide-sequence-based digital inheritance, they represent a possible bridge between analog and digital inheritance in complex chemical systems.", "date": "2024-01-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Chemical Kinetics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Anion redox, which employs the anion sublattice to compensate charge, is a promising way to achieve multielectron cathode materials. Most anion redox materials still face the problems of slow kinetics and large voltage hysteresis. One potential solution to reduce voltage hysteresis is to increase the covalency of the metal-ligand bonds. By substituting Mn into the electrochemically inert Li1.33Ti0.67S2 (Li2TiS3), anion redox can be activated in the Li1.33\u20132y/3Ti0.67\u2013y/3MnyS2 (y = 0 \u2013 0.5) series. Not only do we observe substantial anion redox, but the voltage hysteresis is significantly reduced, and the rate capability is dramatically enhanced. The y = 0.3 phase exhibits excellent rate and cycling performance, maintaining 90% of the C/10 capacity at 1C, which indicates fast kinetics for anion redox. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) shows that both the cation and anion redox processes contribute to the charge compensation. We attribute the drop in hysteresis and increase in rate performance to the increased covalency between the metal and the anion. Electrochemical signatures suggest the anion redox mechanism resembles holes on the anion, but the S K-edge XAS data confirm persulfide formation. The mechanism of anion redox suggests that even if persulfides are formed, the hysteresis and rate performances can still be improved. This work provides insights on how to design cathode materials with anion redox to achieve fast kinetics and low voltage hysteresis.

The reaction operates under mild acidic conditions using acetic acid or an ionic liquid in a highly Trp-selective manner to give the Trp-sulfenylated products. Other than Trp, all other proteinogenic amino acids are unreactive to the sulfenylation conditions. We demonstrated the successful application of this reaction to a variety of peptides, including lysozyme protein. Furthermore, we achieved the Trp-modification of a monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab\u00ae) by a MgCl2-mediated reaction in an acidic ionic liquid. The resulting modified antibody exhibited antibody performance comparable to the parent protein. The presence of an amide moiety in the Acm group contributes to the difference in chemical behavior between S-Acm and S-p-methoxybenzyl (MBzl)-protected cysteine sulfoxide. This is because the S-Acm sulfoxide is converted to S-chlorocysteine responsible for Trp-sulfenylation under less acidic conditions than those required for the reaction of S-MBzl sulfoxide. Based on this rationale, we prepared a linker possessing S-Acm and S-MBzl oxide moieties and subjected the linker to hetero dimerization of DNA-binding Myc and Max peptides containing a Trp handle. The one-pot/stepwise Cys-Trp conjugation between the linker and DNA-binding peptides allowed the generation of a heterodimeric Myc/Max DNA binder.", "date": "2024-01-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Its abundant availability and environmentally friendly nature make it an attractive alternative to conventional cathode materials. However, challenges such as sulfur's intrinsically low electrical conductivity and rapid degradation during cycling still need to be overcome for its widespread adoption in commercial batteries. This study presents an innovative, scalable and straightforward strategy to overcome these challenges of sulfur cathodes in lithium battery applications. Here, we present a novel method, using low-power laser irradiation to fabricate three-dimensional highly micro-porous molecularly dispersed and strongly anchored sulfur-graphene composite electrodes. By subjecting sulfur-embedded carbon precursors to laser irradiation, a well-structured graphene composite is formed, while molecularly-entrapping the sulfur moieties within its framework. This 3D porous architecture provides high surface area for improved electrolyte wetting, efficient ion transport, and effectively accommodates volume changes during cycling while strongly entrapping the active sulfur moieties and remarkably inhibiting the occurrence of the detrimental polysulfide shuttle effect. The resulting sulfur-graphene cathodes exhibit exceptional electrochemical properties. They demonstrate remarkable cyclic stability, sustaining over 1500 cycles with impressive capacity retention of >70% at fast cycling rates, and registering over 1000 mAh g-1 at lower rates with >70% retention over 400 cycles. Furthermore, high sulfur loading ratios, compatible to real world battery applications, are readily attainable. The simplicity and versatility of this laser-based writing single-step approach open various new avenues for the scalable and cost-effective production of high-performance lithium-ion batteries.

Its prevalence and burden have been reported in Turkey, with allergic rhinitis frequencies ranging from 11.8% to 36.4% in five different centers. Asthma prevalence in Turkey varies between 6% and 15% in children and between 2% and 17% in adults. In this context, the aim is to design and develop a device capable of detecting asthma attacks by analyzing respiratory sounds and alerting the patient. The project's objectives include providing rapid pre-attack warnings without disturbing the patient, employing an air pollution sensor, and incorporating two distinct warning mechanisms.\nMethods: This research employs a series of methods to analyze the respiratory sounds of asthma patients and detect asthma attacks. Initially, a literature review was conducted to identify critical factors for detecting asthma attacks, focusing on developing new technologies and non-invasive methods to obtain respiratory sounds. Arduino and MATLAB tools were employed to develop sound analysis and data processing. Subsequently, filtering and statistical calculations were performed.\nIn the final stage, various visualizations such as sound signal, filtered sound signal, FFT, and power spectrum were created to present the obtained results through a user-friendly interface. The two-stage alert system incorporates the ability to detect asthma attacks based on wheezing sounds and air pollution.\nResults: In consideration of the prevalence and severity of asthma, this study addresses a device designed for early diagnosis of the attack. The device is equipped to analyze respiratory sounds within the frequency range of 100-1000 Hz, enabling differentiation between wheezes and rhonchi. The utilization of this device has the potential to enhance the quality of life for asthma patients and provide the opportunity for early intervention by anticipating attack situations.\nConclusion: By focusing on the analysis of respiratory sounds, this research demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring asthma attacks through non-invasive methods.

However, ensuring efficient spin injection while maintaining compatibility with standard semiconductor processing techniques is a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the capability of inducing an ultrafast spin injection into a WSe2 layer from a magnetic CrI3 layer on a femtosecond time scale, achieved through real-time time-dependent density functional theory calculations upon a laser pulse. Following the peak of the magnetic moment in the CrI3 sublayer, the magnetic moment of the WSe2 layer reaches a maximum of 0.89 \u03bcB (per unit cell containing 4 WSe2 and 1 CrI3 units). During the spin dynamic, spin-polarized excited electrons transfer from the WSe2 layer to the CrI3 layer via a type-II band alignment. The large spin splitting in conduction bands and the difference in the number of spin-polarized local unoccupied states available in the CrI3 layer lead to a net spin in the WSe2 layer. Furthermore, we confirmed that the number of empty states, the spin-flip process, and the laser pulse parameters play important roles during the spin injection process.

The two 4f complexes crystallise in the trigonal \ud835\udc433\u0305 space group, have identical chemical formulas and differ only in the placement of the methoxy group on the aromatic ring of salicylaldehyde, with it being either ortho, Yb(trenovan), or para, Yb(trenpvan), to the phenoxo group. This structural isomerism is found to have a profound influence on the solid state static and dynamic magnetic properties of the complexes. In the bulk, both isomers display a combination of direct and raman magnetisation relaxation procceses, however, at vastly different rates. Magnetic dilution in an isostructural diamagnetic host supresses the occurrence of the direct procces suggesting that the direct process observed in the bulk originates from Yb(III) centres coupled by magnetic dipole interactions. The eigenspectrum, eigenvectors and spin lattice relaxation of Yb(trenpvan) are found to be closer to the ones found in Yb(trensal) (H3trensal = tris(((saliclidene)amino)ethyl)amine) where the methoxy group is substituted by an H atom, than to those of Yb(trenovan) where the methoxy group is in the ortho position. Thus, the position of chemical modifications has a tremendous influence on the static and dynamic solid state magnetic properties of 4f coordination complexes.

Cobalt soaps are highly effective catalysts under ambient conditions but viable alternatives based on less scarce catalysts are desirable, with especially iron and manganese catalysts showing potential. Manganese complexes of the ligand N,N',N\"-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane (tmtacn) are long established as catalysts for organic oxidations with H2O2, however their reactivity with alkyl hydroperoxides is less studied especially in low- or apolar solvents. Here we show that this family of complexes can be employed as catalysts for the decomposition of alkyl hydroperoxides in apolar solvents such as styrene/methyl methacrylate mixtures and resins based on styrene/bisphenol-A based diglycidyl ether bismethacrylate (BADGE-MA). The progress of alkene polymerisation in crosslinking resins is followed by Raman spectroscopy to establish its dependence on the oxidation state of the manganese catalyst used, as gelation time and onset of autoacceleration are of particular interest for many applications. We show, through reaction progress monitoring with UV/vis absorption and Raman spectroscopy, that the stability of the manganese complexes in the resin mixtures has a substantial effect on curing progress and that the oxidation state of the resting state of the catalyst is most likely Mn(II), in contrast to reactions with H2O2 as oxidant in which the oxidation state of the resting state of catalyst is Mn(III).

Here, we estimate the amount of noise present in combined data sets by comparing results where results for the same compound are reported in multiple assays against the same target. This approach shows that IC50 assays selected using minimal curation settings have poor agreement with each other: almost 65% of the points differ by more than 0.3 log units, 27% differ by more than one log unit, and the correlation between the assays, as measured by Kendall\u2019s \u03c4 is only 0.51.

KS is the least understood proteoglycan, which in part is due to a lack of panels of well-defined KS oligosaccharides that are needed for structure-binding studies, as analytical standards, to examine substrate specificities of keratinases and for drug development. Here, we report a biomimetic approach that makes it possible to install, in a regioselective manner, sulfates and fucosides on oligo-N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) chains to provide any structural element of KS by using specific enzyme modules. It is based on the observation that 1,3-fucosides, 2,6-sialosides and C-6 sulfation of galactose (Gal6S) are mutually exclusive and cannot occur on the same LacNAc moiety. As a result, the pattern of sulfation on galactosides can be controlled by installing1,3-fucosides or 2,6-sialosides to temporarily block certain LacNAc moieties from sulfation by keratan sulfate galactose 6-sulfotransferase (CHST1). The pattern of 1,3-fucosylation and 2,6-sialylation can be controlled by exploiting the mutual exclusivity of these modifications, which in turn controls the sites of sulfation by CHST1. Late-stage treatment with a fucosidase or sialidase to remove blocking fucosides or sialosides provides selectively sulfated KS oligosaccharides. These treatments also unmasked specific galactosides for further controlled modification by CHST1. To showcase the potential of the enzymatic strategy, we have prepared a range of poly-LacNAc derivatives having different patterns of fucosylation and sulfation and several N-glycans decorated by specific arrangements of sulfates.", "date": "2024-01-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Several selective 2DJ experiments have been proposed that allow their individual measurement at pure shift resolution. However, all these experiments fail in the not uncommon case when coupled protons have very close chemical shifts. Firstly, the coupling between protons with overlapping multiplets is inaccessible due to the inability of a frequency-selective pulse to invert just one of them. Secondly, the strong coupling condition affects the accuracy of coupling measurements involving third spins. These shortcomings impose a limit on the effectiveness of state-of-the-art experiments, such as G-SERF or PSYCHEDELIC. Here, we introduce two new and complementary selective 2DJ experiments that we coin SERFBIRD and SATASERF. These experiments overcome the aforementioned issues by utilizing the 13C satellite signals at natural isotope abundance, which resolve the chemical shift degeneracy. We demonstrate the utility of these experiments on the tetrasaccharide stachyose and the challenging case of norcamphor, for the latter achieving measurement of all JHH couplings while only few were accessible with PSYCHEDELIC.

While palladium(0) based heterogeneous catalysts, such as Pd/C, are commonly used for this purpose, challenges related to functional group tolerance and incomplete iso-tope incorporation are often encountered, particularly with respect to aryl bromides and chlorides. These long-standing issues pose a hurdle to achieving optimal results in tracer synthesis. The limited incorporation of isotopes for aryl bro-mides and chlorides presents a significant obstacle to the application of this method in the preparation of high specific activity tritium tracers. Herein, we present a novel palladium catalytic system using Zn(OAc)2 as an additive, which ena-bles homogeneous dehalogenative deuteration and tritiation using D2/T2 gas. Under mild reaction conditions, a wide range of drug-like aryl halides and pseudohalides undergo selective deuteration with complete isotope incorporation. The reaction displays excellent compatibility with diverse functional groups, including multiple bonds, O/N-benzyl, and cy-ano groups, which are frequently problematic in Pd/C reactions. Furthermore, this method was successfully applied to the tritiation of four halogenated pharmaceutically relevant molecules, resulting in predictable high specific activity per halogen atom (26.5-27.7 Ci/mmol). Notably, the developed system allows gram-scale preparation of a deuterium-containing intermediate, a crucial step in synthesizing a deuterium-labeled drug molecule. A reaction pathway involving a key intermediate, Pd(Ar)OAc, was proposed to activate hydrogen gas during dehalogenative deuteration and tritiation. This innovative method has potential to change the practice of dehalogenative deuteration and tritiation in the realm of hydrogen isotope labeling.

The model provides two convenient approaches to assigning partial charges in the context of the atomic polarizabilities. One is a generalization of RESP, called RESP-dPol, and the other, AM1-BCC-dPol, is an adaptation of the widely used AM1-BCC method. Both are designed to accurately replicate gas-phase QM electrostatic potentials. Benchmarks of this polarizable electrostatic model against gas-phase dipole moments, molecular polarizabilities, bulk liquid densities, and static dielectric constants of organic liquids, show good agreement with the reference values. Of note, the model yields markedly more accurate dielectric constants of organic liquids, relative to a matched non-polarizable force field. MD simulations with this method, which is currently parameterized for molecules containing elements C, N, O, and H, run about only 3.6-fold slower than fixed charge force fields, while simulations with the self-consistent mutual polarization average 4.5-fold slower. Our results suggest that RESP-dPol and AM1-BCC-dPol afford improved accuracy, relative to fixed charge force fields, and are good starting points for developing general, affordable, and transferable polarizable force fields.

In this work, we explore the concept of multi-component liquid-infused systems, in which the coating liquid consists of a primary liquid and a secondary component or components that provide additional functionality. For ease of understanding, we categorize recently reported multi-component liquid-infused surfaces according to the size of the secondary components: molecular scale, in which the secondary components are molecules; nanoscale, in which they are nanoparticles or their equivalent; and microscale, in which the additional components are micrometer size or above. We present examples at each scale, showing how introducing a secondary element into the liquid can result in synergistic effects, such as maintaining a pristine surface while actively modifying the surrounding environment, which are difficult to achieve in other surface treatments.

However, LPS-based batteries operate at a limited current density before short-circuiting, posing a major challenge for the development of application-relevant batteries.

We show experimentally that the C20 carboxy terminus of the G\u03b1 protein can bind to the intracellular region of either TMD2 or TMD3, which can alter GPCR affinity to the high-affinity state for steviol glycosides. These studies provide a mechanistic understanding of the structure and function of this heterodimeric sweet taste receptor that can guide rational structure-based design of novel non-caloric sweeteners aimed at enabling lower sugar usage levels while retaining the sweet taste. This may provide the basis for novel therapeutic applications for treatment of obesity and related metabolic dysfunctions such as diabetes.

The PES is once represented by a full-dimensional or truncated many-body expansion form,  which is obtained by ab initio calculations at each grid mesh point, and then all terms in the expansion are compressed and merged into a single MPO while maintaining the bond dimension of the MPO as small as possible. It was shown that the ab initio PES of the H2CO was compressed by more than two orders of magnitude in the size of the site operators without loss of accuracy. By the use of the grid basis, the tensor rank of the site operators of the MPO is reduced from four to three due to the diagonal nature of the position-dependent operators on the grid basis, which significantly reduces the computational cost of the tensor contractions required in the real and imaginary time evolution of the matrix product state (MPS) wavefunctions with the grid-based MPO   (Grid-MPO) Hamiltonian. Similar to other grid-based methods, the Grid-MPO is readily applicable to any kind of potentials of molecular systems if the values at the grid points are available. Using the Grid-MPO combined with the MPS, we calculated the time correlation function of the Eigen cation \\eigen to predict the infrared (IR) spectrum and compared with the experimental and the previous theoretical study.

By employing the many body decomposition, differences in the binding affinities of the various nicotinoids could be attributed mainly to the proton exchange energy between the Pyridine and non-Pyridine rings of the nicotinoids and the interactions between them and a handful of proximal amino acids, namely Typ156, Typb57, Tyr100, and Tyr204.

The crosslinking of polymers can change their material properties dramatically, and it is advantageous to know a priori whether or not crosslinking polymers will lead to clogged channels or cessation of flow. In this study, we investigate the flow of a common biopolymer, alginate, while it undergoes crosslinking by the addition of a crosslinker, calcium, driven through a microfluidic channel at constant flow rate. We map the boundaries defining complete clogging and flow as a function of flow rate, polymer concentration, and crosslinker concentration. Interestingly, the boundaries of the dynamic behavior qualitatively match the thermodynamic jamming phase diagram of attractive colloidal particles. That is, polymer clogging occurs in a region analogous to colloids in a jammed state, while the polymer flows in regions corresponding to colloids in a liquid phase. However, between the dynamic regimes of complete clogging and unrestricted flow, we observe a remarkable phenomenon in which the crosslinked polymer intermittently clogs the channel. This pattern of deposition and removal of a crosslinked gel is simultaneously highly reproducible, long-lasting, and controllable by system parameters. Higher concentrations of polymer and cross-linker result in more frequent ablation, while gels formed at lower component concentrations ablate less frequently. Upon ablation, the eluted gel maintains its shape, resulting in micro-rods several hundred microns long. Our results suggest both rich dynamics of intermittent flows in crosslinking polymers and the ability to control them.\n", "date": "2024-01-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

To explore the flow characteristics of the real shear thickening fluids over cylindrical surface confined in a channel, we employed the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) within a D2Q9 framework for mesoscopic numerical simulations. The velocity and pressure profiles has been explored to the limit so that effect of real STF can been explored. Our finding are focused on the real STF effects near the cylinder and how it varies with the Reynolds number. We find that the Real shear thickening fluids exhibit a complex changes in the wake flow pattern as compared to Newtonian, power-law shear-thinning and thickening fluids. In case of Real STF, due to low shear rates, we find thinning behaviour near the centerline of the channel (i.e., in the core) of the flow where the cylinder is placed. Hence, the vortex shedding and recirculation is less intense as compare to the power-law Shear Thickening Fluid (STF) and Newtonian flows. We also find that the Real shear thickening fluid flow is more accelerated onto the cylinder and exhibit early separation as compared to the thickening or Newtonian fluid, thereby creates more pressure drag as compared to the Newtonian and pure power-law thickening fluids, whereas due to low viscosity onto the cylinder it creates less skin drag as compared to the Newtonian and pure power-law thickening fluids.

Hydrogen evolution reaction and redox carrier oxidation reaction swings the pH of electrolyte at the cathode and anode to capture CO2 efficiently which avoids side effects through decoupling of electrochemical-swing for CO2 capture and redox carrier regeneration in different times and spatial domains. We demonstrate a stable electrochemical CO2 capture process over 200 hours with low energy consumption (49.15 kJ mol-1 CO2 at 10 mA cm-2). Furthermore, the system is tunable and modular.

Understanding how and why electrolyte ion size impacts electrochemical performance is crucial for developing improved MOF-based devices. To address this, we investigate the energy storage performance of Cu3(HHTP)2 (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene) with a series of 1 M tetraalkylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TAABF4) electrolytes with different cation sizes. Three-electrode experiments show that Cu3(HHTP)2 exhibits higher energy storage upon positive charging and an asymmetric charging response with all ion sizes, with a greater charging asymmetry with larger TAA+ cations. The results further show that smaller TAA+ cations demonstrate superior capacitive performance upon both positive and negative charging compared to larger TAA+ cations. To gain further insights, electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements were performed to probe the ion electrosorption during charging. These reveal that Cu3(HHTP)2 has a cation-dominated charging mechanism, but interestingly indicate that the solvent also participates in the charging mechanism with larger cations. Overall, the results of this study suggest that larger TAA+ cations saturate the pores of the Cu3(HHTP)2-based electrodes, leading to more asymmetric charging and forcing solvent molecules to play a role in the charge storage mechanism.

Ni-rich layered cathode materials offer improved energy densities, but their high interfacial reactivities can negatively impact cycle life and rate performance. Here we investigate the role of electrolyte salt concentration, specifically LiPF6 (0.5-5 m), in altering the interfacial reactivity of charged LiN0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathodes in standard carbonate based electrolytes (EC:EMC vol%:vol% 3:7). Extended potential holds of NMC811/Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) cells reveal that the parasitic electrolyte oxidation currents observed are strongly dependent on the electrolyte salt concentration. X-ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopy (XPS/XAS) reveal that a thicker LixPOyFz-/LiF-rich CEI is formed in the more highly concentrated electrolytes. This suppresses reactions with solvent molecules resulting in a thinner, or less-dense, reduced surface layer (RSL) with lower charge transfer resistance, and lower oxidation currents at high potentials. The thicker CEI also limits access of acidic species to the RSL suppressing transition metal dissolution into the electrolyte, as confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). This provides insight into the main degradation processes occurring at Ni-rich cathode interfaces in contact with carbonate based electrolytes, and how electrolyte formulation can help to mitigate these.", "date": "2024-01-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Metallacycles were identified as key intermediates, and spin crossover from the singlet to the triplet surface has been calculated to facilitate the reductive coupling step responsible for the formation of the four-membered ring. In this work, a series of sterically and electronically differentiated PDI ligands was studied for the [2+2] cycloaddition of ethylene and butadiene to vinylcyclobutane. Kinetic studies revealed that the fastest and the slowest turnover were observed with equally electron-deficient supporting ligands that either feature phenyl-substituted imine carbon atoms (MeBPDI) or a pyrazine core (MePZDI). While the oxidative cyclization was comparatively slow for both catalysts, the rate of reductive coupling \u2013 determined by stoichiometric 13C2H4 labeling studies \u2013 correlated with the TOFs.

Alchemical transformations where each Pi group of pomotrelvir was transformed into its counterpart in nirmatrelvir were performed to unravel the individual contribution of each group of the inhibitor to the binding and reaction processes. We have shown that while a gamma-lactam ring is preferred at position P1, a delta-lactam ring could be an alternative to be incorporated at this position in the design of inhibitors designed against wild-type main protease and for variants presenting mutations at position 166. For the P2 position, tertiary amines are clearly preferred with respect to secondary amines, because the ability to act as a hydrogen bond donor seem to favour more the interaction with the solvent than with the protein, decreasing the affinity for the enzyme. In addition, flexible groups at P2 position disfavour the formation of the covalent complex because they can disrupt the preorganization of the active site, favouring the exploration of non-reactive conformations. The substitution of the P2 group of pomotrelvir by that of nirmatrelvir resulted in a compound, here named as C2, that presents a notable improvement in the binding energy and a higher population of reactive conformations in the Michaelis complex. Analysis of the chemical reaction to form the covalent complex has shown a similar reaction mechanism and activation free energies for pomotrelvir, nirmatrelvir and C2.

Our current study focuses on accurately predicting viscosity in liquid systems using MD descriptors. In this work, we curated a comprehensive dataset of over 4,000 small organic molecules\u2019 viscosities from scientific literature, publications, and online databases. This dataset enabled us to develop quantitative structure\u2013property relationships (QSPR) consisting of descriptor-based and graph neural network models to predict temperature-dependent viscosities for a wide range of viscosities with considerable accuracy. The QSPR models reveal that including MD descriptors improves prediction accuracies of experimental viscosities, particularly at the small data set scale of fewer than a thousand data points. Furthermore, feature importance tools reveal that intermolecular interactions captured by MD descriptors are most important for accurate viscosity predictions. Finally, the QSPR models can accurately capture the inverse relationship between viscosity and temperature for six battery-relevant solvents, some of which were not included in the original data set.

Trimethylation enhancement using diazomethane (TrEnDi) can be used to significantly enhance the signal of glycerophospholipids through the creation of quaternary ammonium groups producing fixed positive charges using 13C-diazomethane in complex lipid extracts. Although TrEnDi requires a strong acid for complete methylation, we report an optimized protocol using 9.6 mM HBF4 with the subsequent addition of a buffer solution that prevents acidic hydrolysis of plasmalogen species and enables the benefits of TrEnDi to be realized for this class of lipids. These optimized conditions were applied to aliquots of bovine liver extract (BLE) to achieve permethylation of plasmalogen lipids within a complex mixture. Treating aliquots of unmodified and TrEnDi-derivatized BLE samples with 80% formic acid and comparing their liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) results to analogous samples not treated with formic acid, enabled the identification of 29 plasmalogen species. On average, methylated plasmalogen species from BLE demonstrated 2.81-fold and 28.1-fold sensitivity gains over unmodified counterparts for phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen species, respectively.

Although the OER is known to induce changes in the surface layer, little is understood about its effect on the bulk of the electrocatalyst and the overall phase stability. Here, we show that under OER conditions a highly active SrCoO3-x electrocatalyst develops bulk lattice instability, which results in the formation of molecular O2 dimers in the bulk and nanoscale amorphization induced via chemo-mechanical coupling. Using high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) and first principles calculations, we unveil the potential-dependent evolution of lattice oxygen inside the perovskite and demonstrate that O2 dimers are stable in a densely packed crystal lattice, thus challenging the assumption that O2 dimers require sufficient inter-atomic spacing. We also show that SrCoO3-x develops unusual amorphous bands under intercalation-induced stress that indicates the lattice requires a remarkably low energy to undergo the order-disorder transition.

Significant research therefore went into the development of data-driven models to predict hot metal silicon content in real-time. However, these models use only a small subset of blast furnace variables that are chosen using prior process knowledge. As each blast furnace is unique in its operation, using pre-selected variables would lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, a machine learning based ensemble feature selection and modeling approach is proposed. In this approach, all the available furnace variables are ranked using multiple feature selection techniques based on their impact on silicon content. The individual ranks are combined to obtain an ensemble ranking of variables and the top variables in the ranking are used to build data-driven silicon prediction models. This approach is applied to an industrial blast furnace wherein 374 variables are used to obtain the ensemble ranking. While some of the top 100 variables in the ensemble ranking matched those that are commonly used in silicon predictions models, several new variables have also been identified. Silicon prediction models trained using the top 100 variables resulted in a hot rate of ~90% demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach. Real-time predictions from the models will enable blast furnace operators to control the silicon content without having to wait for laboratory results.

These materials are mostly crystalline and are characterized by unique composition, polymorph, crystallite size, shape and crystallographic orientation. The crystalline biominerals are generally formed through amorphous, hydrated transient minerals, but in some, the amorphous phases are stable and persist. Using a biomimetic approach, we address aspects of biological mineralization in vitro and gain insight into the processes and interactions that play roles in the natural systems, in-vivo. In this work, we demonstrate two essential but conflicting methods that are likely to act simultaneously in many mineralizing systems. These are directed crystal nucleation on organic templates, and on the other hand, crystal inhibition to produce the transient amorphous phase. The experimental method in this project mimics aspects of biomineralization processes of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nucleation. Polydiacetylene (PDA) \u2013 a robust, linear conjugated polymer, made from amphiphilic long-chain diacetylene monomers, which upon surface compression, followed by UV polymerization form an ultrathin, stable monolayer structure. PDA simulates the organic template for the CaCO3 crystallization in our experimental system in that it exposed a dense array of acidic groups in well-defined orientation and being a semi-rigid template surface. On PDA templates, calcite crystals nucleate from a (01.2) face and in every single domain of the PDA film they are all coaligned with the crystals' a-axes oriented parallel to the polymer backbone. Supersaturated solutions for CaCO3were prepared either by mixing CaCl2 and Na2CO3, or by bubbling CO2 into CaCO3 suspension, or by slow diffusion of ammonium carbonate into CaCl2 solution in a desiccator. Phosphoserine (P-ser) was added to CaCO3 deposition systems as a crystallization inhibitor, which results in amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) deposition. The phosphate groups substitute a part of the carbonate groups during the deposition and this way, inhibit the crystallization process. Various concentrations of P-ser in deposition system on PDA templates result in different morphologies and degrees of crystallinity of CaCO3.  In this biomimetic system, we demonstrate the conflicting, yet simultaneous influences on biological crystal formation, namely the ordered template and crystal nucleation and crystal inhibition.", "date": "2024-01-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Biophysical Chemistry; Materials Chemistry; Crystallography", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

This new method, propelled by gentle enolization with minimal catalyst loading, results in enantiomeric excesses surpassing 95% under ambient conditions, accomplishing total conversion in merely 6 hours. Remarkably, this method eliminates the need for additional functional groups in nitroalkenes for efficient chirality transfer from the organocatalyst. The exceptional reactivity of thioesters, combined with their water tolerance, enables reactions utilizing the hydrophobic effect, resulting in reaction times as short as 15 minutes and products with slightly enhanced stereoselectivity compared to analogous reactions in dichloromethane. Additionally, reactions performed in perfluorinated solvents outpace their homogenous counterparts in organic solvents, delivering products in shorter time with comparable stereoselectivity. This work highlights the rare utilization of the fluorous effect in organocatalysis. Simple squaramides also exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in the reactions of beta-keto thioesters with alpha-bromo nitroalkenes. As little as 0.1 mol% of the catalyst leads to product formation with an 86% yield (qNMR) and 93% enantiomeric excess. Upscaling the reaction does not significantly affect the enantiomeric excess but leads to a slight decrease in yield from 82% to 77%. It has been demonstrated that thioesters react more rapidly than their ketoester counterparts, and the two-step reaction leading to dihydrofuran ring closure is entirely accomplished by extending the reaction time, eliminating the need for additional base.

Although the importance of optimizing OSC-dopant interactions is well-recognized, chemically generalizable structure-function relationships are difficult to extract due to the sensitivity and dependence of doping efficiency to chemistry, processing conditions, and morphology. Computational modelling for integrated OSC-dopant design is an attractive approach to systematically isolate fundamental relationships, but requires the challenging simultaneous treatment of molecular reactivity and morphology evolution. We present the first computational study to couple molecular reactivity with morphology evolution in a molecularly-doped OSC. Reactive Monte Carlo is employed to examine the evolution of OSC-dopant morphologies and doping efficiency with respect to dielectric, the thermodynamic driving for the doping reaction, and dopant aggregation. We observe that for well-mixed systems with experimentally relevant dielectric constants, doping efficiency is near unity with a very weak dependence on the ionization potential and electron affinity of OSC and dopant, respectively. At experimental dielectric constants, reaction-induced aggregation is observed, corresponding to the well-known insolubility of solution-doped materials. Simulations are qualitatively consistent with a number of experimental studies showing a decrease of doping efficiency with increasing dopant concentration. Finally, we observe that the aggregation of dopants lowers doping efficiency, and thus presents a rational design strategy for maximizing doping efficiency in molecularly doped OSCs.

To address this issue, we have developed an efficient pathway for transforming bulk titanium nitride (TiN) into multilayered titanium nitride (M-TiN). This method integrates the intrinsic properties of MXenes with the enhanced stability of TiN, offering a viable solu-tion to the pressing issue of oxidation stability for practical applications. The synthesis of M-TiN avoids the need for inert gas protection or chemical purification steps, making the process both practical and scalable. Notably, M-TiN exhibits inherent stability and improved performance, particularly in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) when coupled with iron phthalocyanine (FePc). The oxidized surface layer of M-TiN enhances stability in corrosive and oxidative environments and facilitates the formation of Fe-O-Ti bonds, effectively modulating the spin states of the Fe center from low spin to medium spin, thereby improving ORR performance. M-TiN/FePc also delivers a greater power density of 270.31 mW cm-2 and better cyclability than Pt/C in a zinc-air battery. The simplicity of M-TiN's synthesis, along with the inherent properties of both MXene and TiN, positions it as a promising material for the future of energy conversion and storage technologies", "date": "2024-01-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Multilayers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This study aimed to explore a novel machine learning approach to classify compounds that inhibit HIV-1 integrase and screen the dataset of repurposing compounds. The present study had two main stages: selecting the best type of fingerprint or molecular descriptor using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and building a computational model based on machine learning. In the first stage, we calculated 16 different types of fingerprint or molecular descriptors from the dataset and used each of them as input features for 10 machine-learning models, which were evaluated through cross-validation. Then, a meta-analysis was performed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to select the optimal fingerprint or molecular descriptor types. In the second stage, we constructed a model based on the optimal fingerprint or molecular descriptor type. This data followed the machine learning procedure, including data preprocessing, outlier handling, normalization, feature selection, model selection, external validation, and model optimization. In the end, an XGBoost model and RDK7 fingerprint were identified to be the most suitable. The model achieved promising results, with an average precision of 0.928 \u00b1 0.027 and an F1-score of 0.848 \u00b1 0.041 in cross-validation.

For this pur-pose, we combined an improved method for chemical reactions on sialic acid residues with FMR-dye hydrazides including dyes commonly used to stain nucleic acids. Fluorescence of FMR dyes increases upon molecular crowding and with increasing viscosity providing options for fluorogenic labelling of cell surfaces and detecting changes of cell surfaces that, for example, affect molecular crowding or local viscosity. The method involves mild periodate oxidation of cell surface glycans followed by or-ganocatalyzed dye conjugation. Both steps are performed within a total of 15 min at 25 \u00b0C, avoiding cold stress of cells. We show labelling glycans with FMR dyes such as 9-(2-carboxy-2-cyanovinyl)julolidine (CCVJ) or Cyanine 3 (Cy3) and the nucleic acid stain thiazole orange (TO) pro-vides sufficiently strong signals to allow fluorescence microscopy imaging of surfaces of A549, HeLa and CEM cells. Measurements with mucin suggest that the close proximity to glycans induced upon formation of covalent bonds is very efficient in hindering FMR torsional motions. We demonstrate that the fluorescence of CCVJ and TO on cell surface glycans and isolated mucin is influenced by the action of the disulfide-cleaving agent TCEP. Co-labelling of cells with CCVJ and an environmentally insensitive AF568 dye revealed a TCEP-induced decrease in the intensity CCVJ fluorescence, which did not occur when the dye was studied in glycerol solution, consistent with a decrease of the fluores-cence lifetime determined by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).

Due to its profound anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, H2S plays important roles in preventing inflammatory skin disorders and improving wound healing. Transdermal H2S delivery is a therapeutically viable option for the man-agement of such disorders. However, current small-molecule H2S donors are not optimally suited for transdermal deliv-ery and typically generate electrophilic byproducts that may lead to undesired toxicity. Here, we demonstrate that H2S release from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) bearing coordinatively unsaturated metal centers is a promising alterna-tive for controlled transdermal delivery of gaseous H2S without the release of unwanted byproducts. In particular, exten-sive gas sorption measurements and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies of eleven MOFs support that the Mg-based framework Mg2(dobdc) (dobdc4\u2212 = 2,5-dioxidobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylate) is uniquely well-suited for transdermal H2S delivery due to its strong yet completely reversible binding of H2S, high capacity (14.7 mmol/g or 33.3 wt% at 1 bar and 25 \u00b0C), and lack of toxicity. In addition, Rietveld refinement of high-quality synchrotron PXRD data from a H2S-dosed mi-crocrystalline sample of Mg2(dobdc) supports that the high H2S capacity of this framework arises due to the presence of three distinct binding sites: at the Mg centers through a Mg\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5S interaction (primary site), through a short S\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5S interaction to the polarized H2S molecules at the primary sites (secondary site), and in the center of the pores (tertiary site). Last, we demonstrate that transdermal delivery of H2S from this framework is sustained over a 24 h period through porcine skin. Not only is this significantly longer than sodium sulfide (Na2S), but this represents the first example of controlled trans-dermal delivery of pure H2S gas. Overall, H2S-loaded Mg2(dobdc) is an easily accessible, solid-state source of H2S, ena-bling safe storage and transdermal delivery of this therapeutically relevant gas.", "date": "2024-01-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Semi-empirical methods have the potential to reduce the computational cost compared to the computationally costly DFT computations. In this study, we have first assessed the performance of four semi-empirical methods (GFN-xtb, GFN2-xtb, PM6-D3 and PM7-D3) to model major reactions for SEI formation and growth. We have included the major decomposition reactions of the most used solvent (ethylene carbonate), most used salt (lithium hexafluorophosphate) and other electrolyte species like the co-solvent 1,3-dioxolane and the additive vinylene carbonate. We have found that PM7-D3 and GFN-xtb are the two best performing methods for the 32 tested reactions. Finally, we have performed PM7-D3 and GFN-xtb -based molecular dynamics for inorganic/organic interfaces. We have found that LiF is the most rigid salt, which barely reconstructs. In contrast, Li2O is subject to severe reconstruction at the GFN-xtb level of theory, but significantly less when using PM7-D3. Still, even at the PM7-D3 level of theory Li2O readily reacts with alkyl carbonates, leading to CO2 dissociation and thus the formation of surface carbonates. When in contact with ethylene carbonate, the organic molecules undergo partial dehydrogenation reactions and ring openings. This suggests that Li2O is overly reactive to be in direct contact with such organic molecules. Rather, it is surrounded by a passivating (mono-)layer of Li2CO3. Indeed, our simulations suggest that such a hybrid system (core of Li2O, shell of Li2CO3, solvated with ethylene carbonate) the organic solvent remains intact.

Furthermore, our efforts to understand the basis for the greater reactivity of SINO relative to PINO have shed further light on the interplay of thermodynamic and kinetic factors in these HAT reactions and sug-gest that transition state (TS) polarization is a particularly important consideration. This is illustrated by the essentially identi-cal reactivity of tetrachloro-PINO and SINO despite the significantly greater thermodynamic driving force in the reactions of the latter. Such measures of HAT TS polarization (i.e., proton affinity of the N-oxide anion) may be useful parameters in pre-dicting and/or rationalizing reactivity in addition to reaction energetics (i.e., O-H bond dissociation enthalpy of the N-OH moie-ty). Building on these insights, we report the design and initial characterization of a chlorinated SINO derivative that has signif-icantly greater reactivity as a HAT catalyst than either PINO or its chlorinated derivative.", "date": "2024-01-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Organocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In comparison, an interpellet In2O3/SAPO-34 admixture yielded majority olefins (cumulative selectivity of ~67% at cumulative TON over 60) due to a lesser degree of secondary hydrogenation (cumulative P/O ratio of ~0.2) on the BAS in SAPO-34, which has a lower acid strength as compared to SSZ-13. Interestingly, both interpellet admixtures of In2O3/SSZ-13 and In2O3/SAPO-34 remained stable during tandem CO2 hydrogenation by favoring the olefin cycle and suppressing the formation of deactivation-inducing-aromatics, unlike MTO, where both admixtures showed fast deactivation.

We find that the different adsorption preferences of the intermediates on Pt (adsorption via carbon atoms) and on Ag (adsorption via oxygen atoms) lead to different preferred reaction pathways, resulting in different products. The reaction pathways on both surfaces involve glyceraldehyde as a key intermediate, however, upon further oxidation, Pt(111) preferentially produces glyceric acid (CH2OH-CHOH-COOH), while on Ag(111) C-C bonds are broken and leads to production of glycolaldehyde and formic acid (CH2OH-CHO and HCOOH).

Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMD) constitute well-known example of such, with particularly high potential for excellent sensing of NO2. It is known, that the adsorption of this hazardous molecule varies on the TMD composition, however the importance of transition metal and chalcogen types were never previously contrasted. Moreover, the other NOx compounds, namely NO and N2, interact much less with TMD sheets, the reason for which is not yet well understood. This work utilizes density functional theory (DFT) approach to untangle these problems by examining the adsorption processes of NO2, NO, and N2 on the monolayers of WS2, MoS2, and MoSe2. The calculations allowed to establish two important conclusions: (i) the chalcogen is significantly more important than transition metal, allowing for much greater increase in adsorption of NO2 on MoSe2 than on WS2, as compared to that on MoS2, (ii) only molecules acting as an acceptor with respect to the TMD sheet can benefit from the enhancement coming from the composition of the latter.

Previously, it was demonstrated that cellulose can be dissolved in a non-heated, short-duration process using an aqueous pyrrolidinium hydroxide solution. In this study, we dissolved cellulose in aqueous N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium hydroxide solution ([C4mpyr][OH]/H2O) and investigated the cellulose regeneration process based on changes in solubility upon application of CO2 gas. We investigated the effect of transformation of the anion chemical structure on cellulose solubility by flowing CO2 gas into [C4mpyr][OH]/H2O and conducted pH, FT-IR, and 13C NMR measurements. We observed that the changes in anion structure allowed for the modulation of cellulose solubility in [C4mpyr][OH]/H2O, thus establishing a simple and safe cellulose regeneration process. This regeneration process was also applied to enable the production of cellulose hydrogels. The hydrogel formed using this approach was revealed to be of a higher mechanical strength than that of an analogous hydrogel produced using the same dissolution solvent with addition of a cross-linker.

Although some theoretical and simulation studies suggest that charge regulation plays an important role in intermolecular interations, experi- mental evidence supporting such view is very scarce. In the current study, we used a model system, composed of a long polyanion interacting with cationic oligolysines, containing up to 8 lysine residues. We showed using both simulations and experiments that while these lysines are only weakly charged in the absence of the polyanion, they charge up and condense on the polycations if the pH is close to the pKa of the lysine side chains. We show that the lysines coexist in two distinct populations within the same solution: 1. practically non-ionized and free in solution; 2. highly ionized and condensed on the polyanion.

This enzyme is part of a broader family of PTPs that all play important regulatory roles in vivo. Common to these enzymes is a highly conserved aspartic acid (D421 in SHP-1) that acts as an acid/base catalysis during the PTP-catalyzed reaction. This residue is located on a mobile loop, the WPD-loop, the dynamical behavior of which is intimately connected to catalytic activity. The SHP-1 WPD-loop variants H422Q, E427A, and S418A have been kinetically characterized and compared to the WT enzyme. These variants exhibit limiting magnitudes of kcat ranging from 43% to 77% of the WT enzyme. However, their pH profiles are significantly broadened in the basic pH range. As a result, above pH 6 the E427A and S418A variants have notably higher turnover numbers than WT SHP-1. Molecular modeling results indicate that the shifted pH dependencies result primarily from changes in solvation and hydrogen-bonding networks that affect the pKa of the D421 residue, explaining the changes in pH-rate profiles for kcat on the basic side. In contrast, a previous study of a noncatalytic residue variant of the PTP YopH, which also exhibited changes in pH dependency, showed that catalytic change arose from mutation-induced changes in conformational equilibria of the WPD-loop.

In this study, we investigate the CO2RR on electrodeposited Cu-Ag nanostructures obtained using a green choline chloride and urea deep eutectic solvent (DES). We show that Cu-Ag nanostructured electrocatalysts with tunable composition, loadings, and size can be simply prepared in one step, without adding other additives or surfactant agents. We investigate the intrinsic activity and selectivity of the CO2RR by determining the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) using lead underpotential deposition (UPD). The analysis of the partial current densities normalized by the ECSA shows that the addition of Ag on electrodeposited Cu primarily suppresses the production of hydrogen and methane with respect to Cu nanostructures. At the same time, the production of carbon monoxide (CO) slightly increases but, the partial current of the total C2+ products does not considerably increase. Despite that the production rate of C2+ is similar on Cu and CuAg, the addition of Ag enhances the formation of alcohols and oxygenates over ethylene, in line with previous reports.

This is possible for zeolites with 12-ring or larger pores, but requires higher temperatures in medium pore zeolites. The first chemical events in this process occur fast, even at room temperature, and imply the loss of aromaticity likely by formation of an adduct between ozone and the imidazole ring through carbons C4 and C5. Subsequent rupture of the imidazole ring provides smaller and more flexible fragments that can desorb more readily. This  process has been studied experimentally, mainly through infrared spectroscopy, and theoretically by density functional theory. Amazingly, fluoride anions occluded in the small double four-ring units (d4r) during the synthesis remain inside the cage throughout the whole process when the temperature is not too high (\u2264 150 oC). However, fluoride in larger cages in MFI ends up bonded to silicon in penta or hexacoordinated units, likely out of the cages, after ozone treatment at 150 \u00baC. For several germanosilicate zeolites, the process allows their subsequent degermanation to yield stable high-silica zeolites. Quaternary ammonium cations, require harsher conditions that eventually also extract fluoride from zeolite cages, including the d4r unit.

As opposed to the constant-current technique, pulsed current techniques apply intermittently stopped current flows.  This work investigates the electroplating of metallic Li onto a Cu foil current collector under constant-current and pulsed current formation protocols. In addition to smoother, less resistive electroplated metallic Li deposits and increased Coulombic efficiency, we show that by employing an optimized pulsed current formation protocol, the formation process is accelerated by a factor of 2 compared to a C/20 protocol.

Despite the existence of many well-known TYR (tyrosinase) inhibitors commercialized in skin formulations, their hsTYR-inhibition efficacy remains poor since most of them were investigated over mushroom tyrosinase (abTYR), a model with low homology relative to hsTYR. Considering the need for new potent hsTYR inhibitors, we designed and synthesized a series of indanones starting from 4-hydroxy compound 1a, one of the two most active derivatives reported to date against the human enzyme, together with marketed thiamidol. We observed that analogues featuring 4-amino and 4-amido-2\u2019,4\u2019-dihydroxyindanone motifs showed two- to ten-fold increase in activity over human melanoma MNT-1 cell lysates, and a ten-fold improvement in a 4-days whole-cell experiment, compared to parent analogue 1a. Molecular docking investigation was performed for the most promising 4-amido derivatives and suggested a plausible interaction pattern with the second coordination sphere of hsTYR, notably through hydrogen bonding with Glu203, confirming their impact in the binding mode with hsTYR active site.", "date": "2024-01-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In our search for new magnetic materials with enhanced features as positive contrast probes for MRI, we decided to explore the chemical space to comprehensively analyze the effects of different metals on the performance of iron oxide nanomaterials already able to provide positive contrast in MRI.

The asymmetric reduction of \u03b2-keto esters using cell-free enzymes presents a viable approach to manufacture enantiomerically pure \u03b2-hydroxy esters. However, the unbearable economic costs underlying enzymes and cofactors call for innovative approaches to maximize their reusability. Herein, we develop two self-sufficient Heterogeneous Biocatalysts (ssHBs) for the enantiodivergent reduction of \u03b2-keto esters to yield enantiomerically pure \u03b2-hydroxy esters. A thermophilic (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase from Thermus thermophilus HB27 (TtHBDH) and an (R)-specific ketoreductase from Lactobacillus kefir (LkKRED) are selected, kinetically characterised, and immobilised onto macroporous agarose beads. Finally, the immobilised enzymes are coated with cationic polymers to co-immobilise the required redox cofactors. The resulting ssHBs catalyse the asymmetric reduction of \u03b2-keto esters without the exogenous supply of NAD(P)H and using 2-propanol as an ancillary electron donor. Then, we construct two enantiodivergent packed bed reactors (PBRs) integrating these two ssHBs and determine their optimal operational parameters through condition screening and kinetic simulations. The ssHBs in continuous flow operation exhibit good operational stability, illustrated by a maximum Space-Time Yield (STY) of 49.5 g L-1 h-1 for the continuous production of enantiopure ethyl 3-(R)-hydroxybutyrate over 21 days. Under these conditions, LkKRED and NADPH achieve total turnover numbers of 9.3 x 105 and 2.7 x104, respectively.

The accurate determination of reactivity ratios from copolymerizations where one or both monomers undergo reversible propagation, however, has been complicated by difficulty in solving the underlying population balance equations, the presence of myriad copolymer equations in the literature derived under varying assumptions and simplifications, and lack of an easy to fit integrated model. Here, we rectify and assert the consistency between previously reported copolymer equations of disparate form, introduce a new method to explicitly solve the underlying population balance equations, and perform stochastic copolymerization simulations to evaluate the ability of these three methods to produce consistent comonomer consumption predictions and fits to simulated copolymerization data. We find that all methods produce consistent predictions given the same input parameters, which implies both accuracy and precision when modeling copolymerization, fitting experimental data, and making predictions of comonomer sequence. Considering this consistency, we make a recommendation to use numerical integration of the appropriate copolymer equation to fit real copolymerization data due to its ease of implementation and single subjective parameter for implementation. We further identify the minimum number of parameters required for accurate data fitting and suggest ways to measure other information ex situ from copolymerization to expediate accurate fitting.

However, many materials are obtained as polycrystalline powders with large unit cells and/or complex structures, making it challenging to investigate detailed structural changes using conventional X-ray diffraction techniques. Here, we employ time-resolved 3D electron diffraction (3D ED) to unravel the topotactic reactions and transformations of extra-large pore silicate zeolites ECNU-45 to ECNU-46. Notably, ECNU-45 features 3D interconnecting 24\u00d710\u00d710-ring channels, while ECNU-46 exhibits 1D 24-ring channels connected to 10-ring pockets. ECNU-45 and ECNU-46 are the first reported examples of pure silicate zeolites with pores larger than 22-rings. Our findings showcase detailed changes at six distinct tetrahedral Si sites, involving atom displacement, addition, and removal of framework atoms through bond breakage and formation. This work not only presents the discovery of novel zeolites but also provides unprecedented atomic-level insights into the dynamic processes of topotactic reactions.

The current study reports the design and synthesis of a novel class of water-soluble poly(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE)-based CPEs, featuring cationic trimethyl phosphonium (-PMe3+) moieties as pendant groups. A series of four CPEs were prepared which vary in the number of -PMe3+ groups and the length of the side-chains linking the phosphonium groups to the PPE backbone (3- or 6-carbon linkers). The polymers\u2019 molecular weights (MW) were estimated by diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) in methanol relative to poly(ethylene glycol) standards, and MW values ranging from 10 \u2013 30 kD were recovered. The photophysical properties of the new CPEs were assessed by steady state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy analysis, using polymer solutions in water and methanol. Interesting relationships were observed between the optical properties and the structural variations of the new CPEs. Namely, the fluorescence reveals that the CPEs aggregate in water, with the degree of aggregation increasing with fewer -PMe3+ groups, and longer side-chains. The fluorescence quantum yields of the CPEs in methanol are high, with one exhibiting > 90% yield. Transient absorption spectroscopy on timescales from picoseconds to microseconds probes the excited state structure and dynamics of the CPEs in water and methanol. The singlet exciton state decays more rapidly in water due to non-radiative decay promoted by aggregation states. Excitation of the polymers produces triplet excitons and studies using singlet oxygen (1O2) phosphorescence and an anthracene-based probe confirm that 1O2 is produced by sensitization.

Their structural and biophysical data are thus highly valuable, not only for the understanding of basic mechanisms but also for designing potent glycoconjugate therapeutics against target MLGIs. However, such information for some important MGLIs remain poorly understood, which has greatly limited the research progress in this area. We have recently developed densely glycosylated nanoparticles (e.g., ~4 nm quantum dot (QD) or ~5 nm gold nanoparticle (GNP)) as new mechanistic probes for MLGIs. Using two important tetrameric viral receptors, DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR as model lectins, we have shown these probes not only can offer sensitive fluorescence readouts for MLGI affinity quantification, but also reveal key structural information (e.g., binding site orientation and binding mode) that are very useful for MLGI targeting. However, the relatively small sizes of scaffolds may not be optimal for maximizing MLGI affinity and targeting specificity. Herein, using -manno-1,2-biose (DiMan) functionalized GNPs (GNP-DiMan) probes, we have systematically studied how GNP scaffold size (e.g., 5, 13, and 27 nm) and glycan density (e.g., 100, 75, 50 and 25%) determine their MLGI affinities, thermodynamics, and antiviral properties. We have developed a new GNP fluorescence quenching assay format for quantifying MLGI affinity to minimize the potential interference from GNP\u2019s strong inner filter effect, revealing that increasing GNP size is highly beneficial to enhance MLGI affinity. We have further determined the MLGI thermodynamics by combining temperature-dependent affinity measurement and Van\u2019t Hoff analysis, revealing that GNP-DiMan-DC-SIGN/R binding is enthalpy driven. Finally, we find that increasing GNP size significantly enhances the antiviral potency. Notably, the DiMan functionalised 27 nm GNP (G27-DiMan) potently and robustly blocks both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR mediated pseudo-Ebola virus cellular entry with an EC50 of ~23 and ~49 pM, respectively, placing it the most potent glycoconjugate entry inhibitor against DC-SIGN/R mediated Ebola cellular infections.", "date": "2024-01-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Biophysics; Chemical Biology; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In NMR-based metabolomics studies, specific NMR pulse sequences such as the standard 1D nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), 1D Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG), and 1D diffusion-edited sequences are commonly utilized to detect distinctive NMR characteristics of small molecule and macromolecule metabolites in plasma or serum samples. However, conducting NMR experiments on multiple samples in metabolomics can be time-consuming. This study introduces the Spectrum-Edited Neural Network (SENNet) for efficient and accurate separation of spectral signals from both macromolecules and small molecules in 1H NMR spectra. The proposed model provides an end-to-end mapping of the entire metabolome NMR spectrum to the macromolecular and small molecule NMR spectra. To validate and optimize the model's hyperparameters, we employed a total of 113 serum samples. Furthermore, the SENNet method was applied to post-process 1D NOESY-presat spectra obtained from 120 plasma samples and 463 serum samples, which were then compared with the corresponding 1D CPMG spectra and 1D diffusion-edited spectra. Our results demonstrate the effective extraction of small molecule signals using the proposed method, as confirmed by comparison with experimental spectra. Principal component analysis (PCA) performed on the macromolecule and small molecule signals reveals comparable statistical information to analyses conducted using experimental data, indicating the efficiency of the SENNet method for signal extraction.

Boysen; Ilona Christy Unarta; Xuefeng Du; Yixuan Li; Xuhui Huang", "abstract": "Identifying transitional states is crucial for understanding protein conformational changes that underlie numerous fundamental biological processes. Markov state models (MSMs) constructed from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have demonstrated considerable success in studying protein conformational changes, which are often associated with rare events transiting over free energy barriers. However, it remains challenging for MSMs to identify the transition states, as they group MD conformations into discrete metastable states and do not provide information on transition states lying at the top of free energy barriers between metastable states. Inspired by recent advances in trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) for detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data, we present Transition State identification via Dispersion and vAriational principle Regularized neural neTworks (TS-DART). This deep learning approach effectively detects the transition states from MD simulations using hyperspherical embeddings in the latent space.  The key insight of TS-DART is to treat the transition state structures as OOD data, recognizing that the transition states are less populated and exhibit a distributional shift from metastable states. Our TS-DART method offers an end-to-end pipeline for identifying transition states from MD simulations. By introducing a dispersion loss function to regularize the hyperspherical latent space, TS-DART can discern transition state conformations that separate multiple metastable states in an MSM. Furthermore, TS-DART provides hyperspherical latent representations that preserve all relevant kinetic geometries of the original dynamics. We demonstrate the power of TS-DART by applying it to a 2D-potential, alanine dipeptide and the translocation of a DNA motor protein on DNA. In all these systems, TS-DART outperforms previous methods in identifying transition states. As TS-DART integrates the dimensionality reduction, state decomposition, and transition state identification in a unified framework, we anticipate that it will be applicable for studying transition states of protein conformational changes.", "date": "2024-01-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Four bright fluorogens with emissions ranging from green to red were identified and applied in wash-free live cell imaging experiments with good contrast and selectivity. A HaloTag mutant adapted from previous literature reports was also tested and shown to further improve the brightness and reaction rate of the most promising fluorogen of the series both in vitro and in cells. This work opens new possibilities to develop bright chemogenetic reporters with diverse photophysical and biological properties by exploring a potentially large chemical space of simple dipolar fluorophores in combination with protein engineering.", "date": "2024-01-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To fully exploit these effects in the design of mechano- or piezochromic materials, self-healing polymers, and other mechanoresponsive devices, a detailed knowledge about the distribution of mechanical strain in the material is essential. Within the past decade, the Judgement of Energy DIstribution (JEDI) analysis has emerged as a useful tool for this purpose. Based on the harmonic approximation, the strain energy in each bond length, bond angle and dihedral angle of a deformed system is calculated using quantum chemical methods. This allows the identification of the force-bearing scaffold of the system, leading to an understanding of mechanochemical processes at the most fundamental level. Here we present a publicly available code that generalizes the JEDI analysis, which has previously only been available for isolated molecules. Now the code has been extended to two- and three-dimensional periodic systems, supramolecular clusters, and substructures of chemical systems under various types of deformation. Due to the implementation of JEDI into the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), the JEDI analysis can be interfaced with a plethora of program packages that allow the calculation of electronic energies for molecular systems and systems with periodic boundary conditions. The automated generation of a color-coded three-dimensional structure via the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) program allows insightful visual analyses of the force-bearing scaffold of the strained system.

However, the in-situ real-time visualization of electrochemical reactions, which can shed light on various critical unknown insights on the electrochemical processes, still remains the bottleneck for fully exploiting their intrinsic potential. In this work, for the first time, a universal approach to the direct spatiotemporal-dynamic in-situ optical visualization of pH based as well as specific byproduct based electrochemical reactions is performed. As a highly relevant and impactful example, the in-operando optical visualization of on-catalyst water splitting processes is performed under neutral water/seawater conditions. pH based visualization are performed using a water-soluble fluorescent pH probe HPTS (8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonicacid), known for its exceptional optical capability of detecting even the tiniest environment pH changes, thus allowing the unprecedented \u201cspatiotemporal\u201d real-time visualization at the cathode and anode. The successful experimental investigations embarked here, allowed us to reach several yet unveiled deeper insights into the spatiotemporal water splitting processes and their practical modulation for potentially improving the applicability and efficiency of water splitting devices. As a result, we were able to unprecedentedly reveal that at a critical cathode-to-anode distance, a continuous bulk-electrolyte \u201cself-neutralization\u201d phenomenon can be achieved during the water splitting process, leading to the practical realization of enhanced additive-free neutral water splitting. Furthermore, we experimentally unveiled that at increasing electrolyte flow rates, a swift and severe inhibition of the concomitantly forming acidic and basic \u2018fronts\u2019, developed at anode and cathode compartments is observed, thus acting as a continuous on-catalysts \u201cbuffering\u201d mechanism that allows for a remarkably enhanced water splitting process. Furthermore, to demonstrate the universal applicability of this elegant strategy which is not limited to pH changes, the technique was extended to visualization of specific electrochemical process by the use of reaction product-specific fluorophore. For the purpose, N-(4-butanoic acid) dansylsulfonamide (BADS) fluorophore was successfully explored to in-situ visualize the formation of hypochlorite/ chlorine at the anode during electrolysis of sea water. Thus, a unique experimental tool that allow real-time spatiotemporal visualization and simultaneous mechanistic investigation of complex electrochemical processes in developed that can be universally extended to various fields of research.

A simple version would be to first predict the API crystal structure and from it the corresponding properties of solubility, morphology, and growth rates, assume that the nucleation would be controlled by seeding, and then use these parameters to design the crystallization process. This is usually an over-simplification as most APIs are polymorphic, and the most stable crystal of the API alone may not have the required properties for development into a drug product. This perspective, from the experience of a Lilly Digital Design project, considers the fundamental theoretical basis of crystal structure prediction (CSP), free energy, solubility, morphology and growth rate prediction, and the current state of nucleation simulation. This is illustrated by applying the modeling techniques to real examples, olanzapine and succinic acid.

However, prior to analysis, the contents of these samples are unknown and could be comprised of thousands of known and unknown chemical constituents. Moreover, it is unknown which part of the chemical space is sufficiently retained and eluted using RPLC. Therefore, we present a generic framework that uses a data driven approach to predict whether molecules fall \"inside\", \"maybe\" inside, or \"outside\" of the RPLC subspace. Firstly, three retention index random forest (RF) regression models were constructed that showed that molecular fingerprints are able to predict RPLC retention behavior. Secondly, these models were used to setup the dataset for building a RPLC RF classification model. The RPLC classification model was able to correctly predict whether a chemical belonged to the RPLC subspace with an accuracy of 92% for the testing set. Finally, applying this model to the 91737 small molecules (i.e., <=1000 Da) in NORMAN SusDat showed that 19.1% fall \"outside\" of the RPLC subspace.

The electrode resistance was found to reduce with increasing bias due to its MIEC character. These electrodes performed even under extreme currents (~ 2A/cm2) without significant overpotential penalty. Reaction was evaluated under various CO2 and H2 concentrations.

Gas-phase cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) via ion/ion reactions between multiply charged protein cations and singly charged cross-linker anions has previously been developed to obtain low-resolution structural information of proteins. This method significantly shortens experimental time relative to conventional solution-phase XL-MS, but has several technical limitations, including (1) the singly deprotonated, N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (sulfo-NHS)-based cross-linker anions are restricted to attachment at neutral amine groups of basic amino acid residues and (2) analyzing terminal cross-linked fragment ions is insufficient to unambiguously localize sites of linker attachment. Herein, we demonstrate enhanced structural information for alcohol-denatured A-state ubiquitin obtained from an alternative gas-phase XL-MS approach. Briefly, singly sodiated ethylene glycol bis(sulfosuccinimidyl succinate) (sulfo-EGS) cross-linker anions enable covalent cross-linking at both ammonium and amine groups. Additionally, covalently modified internal fragment ions, along with terminal b-/y-type counterparts, improve the determination of linker attachment sites. Molecular dynamics simulations validate experimentally obtained gas-phase conformations of denatured ubiquitin obtained herein. This method has identified four cross-linking sites across 8+ ubiquitin, including two new sites in the N-terminal region of the protein that were originally inaccessible in prior gas-phase XL approaches. The two N-terminal cross-linking sites suggest that the N-terminal half of ubiquitin is more compact in gas-phase conformations. By comparison, the two C-terminal linker sites indicate the signature transformation of this region of the protein from a native to a denatured conformation. Overall, the results suggest that the solution-phase secondary structures of A-state ubiquitin are conserved in the gas phase. This method also provides sufficient sensitivity to differentiate between two gas-phase conformers of the same charge state with subtle structural variations.

Here, we use a combination of density-functional theory (DFT) simulations and transient kinetic models (TKMs) to simulate the kinetics of steam reforming of methane (SRM) on Ru(211) surfaces under static and dynamic applied charges. DFT-calculated binding energies of SRM intermediates and transition states exhibit strong sensitivity to positive applied charges and follow scaling relationships unique from periodic trends across transition metals. Our simulations demonstrate that applying a small positive charge to Ru dramatically enhances the steady-state turnover frequency (TOF) of SRM by up to five orders of magnitude above the TOF observed over neutral Ru. Thus, statically charging Ru catalysts may be an effective strategy to lower the temperature requirements for SRM. Dynamic square wave oscillations in charge resulted in SRM catalytic resonance over a broad range of frequencies (f ~ 106 Hz \u2013 1011 Hz), with the corresponding average TOFs exceeding the statically charged Ru surface by an additional 15%. Based on sensitivity analyses performed for the two endpoints of oscillation, we propose that dynamic TOF improvement beyond the Sabatier maximum can be expected when the system is oscillated between two kinetic regimes that are uniquely controlled by distinct elementary steps.", "date": "2024-01-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Theory - Computational; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Previous research primarily addressed dissolution mitigation through electrode or materials engineering, often neglecting the substantial influence of the electrolyte. Herein, we use a highly concentrated electrolyte with a small-molecule organic positive electrode based on pillar[5]quinone (P5Q) with a high theoretical specific capacity of 446 mAh g\u22121, encapsulated within CMK-3 as mesoporous carbon, achieving record cycling performance with improved cycling stability even at elevated temperature (40 \u00b0C). Using 5 M sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide in succinonitrile as electrolyte, the P5Q@CMK-3 composite electrode delivers 430 mAh g\u22121 specific discharge capacity at 0.2C and retains 90% of this value over 200 cycles. This corresponds to an impressive energy density of 831 Wh kg\u22121 (based on P5Q mass) and surpasses previous reports based on pillarquinones as electrode material. When operated at 40 \u00b0C, the P5Q@CMK-3 composite electrodes deliver a record-specific discharge capacity of 438 mAh g\u22121 with 88% capacity retention over 500 cycles, which translates to a minimal capacity decay of only 0.02% per cycle, and with ca. 100% Coulombic efficiency.

However, the mechanism that these enzymes utilize to precisely modulate the chemoselectivity and distinguishing between competing alkene double bond oxidations and allylic hydroxylations is sometimes not clear, which hampers the rational design of specific biocatalysts. In a previous work, a P450 from Labrenzia aggregata (P450LA1) was engineered in the laboratory using directed evolution to catalyze the direct oxidation of trans-b- methylstyrene to phenylacetone. The final variant, KS, was able to overcome the intrinsic preference for alkene epoxidation to directly generate a ketone product via the formation of a highly reactive carbocation intermediate. Here, additional library screening along the evolutionary lineage permitted to serendipitously detect a mutation that overcomes epoxidation and carbonyl formation by exhibiting a large selectivity towards allylic oxidation. A multiscalar computational methodology was applied to reveal the molecular basis towards this hydroxylation preference.

Until to date, numerous (hetero)cumulenes have been detected in the interstellar medium and are assumed to be important intermediates in prebiotic chemistry, in particular when containing nitrogen and oxygen functionalities.  Using a mild ligand exchange reaction at carbon in metalated ylides, we have now succeeded in the synthesis and gram-scale isolation of the so far elusive cyanoketene anion, [NC3O]-. Despite its assumed cumulene-like structure and the delocalization of the negative charge across the whole 5-atomic molecule, it features a bent geometry in solid state with a nucleophilic central carbon atom. Computational studies reveal an ambiguous bonding situation in the anion, which can only be illustrated by a combination of different resonance structures. Nonetheless, the anion features a remarkable stability, thus allowing the storage of its potassium salt and its application as highly functional synthetic building block. The cyanoketene anion readily reacts with a series of small molecules to more complex organic compounds including industrially valuable compounds such as cyanoacetate.

Previously, we developed a Pd(II)/sulfoxide-2-hydroxypridine (SOHP) catalytic system for asymmetric C(sp3)-H functionalization reactions. In this study, our focus is on unraveling the chemistry of chiral palladacycles involved in the Pd(II)-catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)-H functionalization.

Herein, we present three structurally related iron meso-phenylporphyrins whose aggregation properties are expected to be different in commonly used N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) electrolyte.  Both spectroscopy and light scattering are used to provide evidence of extensive porphyrin aggregation under conventional electrocatalytic conditions. Using the electrocatalytic reduction of CO\u2082 to CO as a test reaction, cyclic voltammetry reveals an inverse dependence of kinetics on catalyst concentration for all three porphyrins. The inhibition at higher catalyst concentrations extends to bulk performance, where up to 75% of the catalyst at 1 mM is inactive compared to at 0.25 mM. We additionally report how aggregation is perturbed by organic additives, axial ligands, and porphyrin redox state. Periodic boundary calculations are used to gain additional insights into aggregate stability as a function of metalloporphyrin structure.

Whereas, Ag(I) and Pd(II) ions were chelated by partial cone conformation of calix[1]pyrrole[2]thiazole in a bidentate fashion.

The protein \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) has emerged as a promising biomarker candidate for PD, but a lack of analytical methods to measure complex disease-associated variants of \u03b1-syn has prevented its widespread use as a biomarker. Antibody-based methods such as immunoassays and mass spectrometry-based approaches have been used to measure a limited number of \u03b1-syn forms; however, these methods fail to differentiate variants of \u03b1-syn that only display subtle differences in sequence and structure.

To show the dependence of the properties on the concentration, we simulated both pure IL and ternary mixtures of IL, EC and DMC with different mixing ratios. The solvation of lithium cations in pure and mixed IL/organic carbonate solvents has been investigated. The MD simulations have predicted a preference of Li+ ions to interact with DMC molecules within its first solvation shell rather than with the highly polar EC ones in the IL/carbonate mixtures, a phenomon which is attributed to the local tetrahedral packing of the solvent molecules in the first solvation shell of Li+ ions.The coordination of the O/N atoms of the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion to Li+ ions as well as to the most acidic H atom of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cation has also been analysed, which showed a marked increase in the amplitude of RDF peaks with increase in carbonate concentration, indicating that the interaction between the ions was enhanced by the presence of high carbonate content.

Benefiting from a wide range of possible phosphorus oxidation states, phosphosulfide semiconductors exist as thiophosphate compounds with various types of P-S polyanions, as genuine multi-anion compounds with or without P-P bonds, as solid solutions, and as many intermediate cases. Since metal phosphides and metal sulfides are among the highest-performing optoelectronic semiconductors, it seems reasonable to consider the phosphosulfide family as a potential pool of materials for solar cells, photoelectrochemical cells, and light-emitting diodes. Nevertheless, phosphosulfide semiconductors have very rarely been characterized with these applications in mind. In this Perspective, we reflect on the potential applicability of known and hypothetical phosphosulfides as light absorbers and emitters in optoelectronic devices. First, we distill the existing knowledge accessible through the Materials Project database, finding promising phosphosulfides among the compounds already present in the database, and identifying what we see as the general advantages and challenges of phosphosulfides as optoelectronic materials. Then, we propose three concrete research directions aimed at finding novel high-quality phosphosulfide semiconductors with high light absorption coefficients, high carrier mobilities, and long carrier lifetimes. In particular, we argue that the versatility of phosphorus in this class of materials could potentially be exploited to engineer defect tolerance.

The relatively few reported Sn(II)-O-M (M = early transition metal cation) solids frequently decompose at moderate to low temperatures. Herein, a large-scale predictive modeling approach was used to assess the structural factors yielding their enhanced thermodynamic stability. This has resulted in ten predicted new Sn(II)-containing oxides that are proposed to fall within reasonable synthetic limits.  Increasing stability was found for structures possessing smaller amounts of Sn(II) with local asymmetric coordination environments allowing expression of its stereoactive lone pair. As a test of these results, synthetic efforts to prepare one of the proposed compounds starting from BaLa4Ti4O15 yielded the predicted noncentrosymmetric layered perovskite SnLa4Ti4O15 (SLTO). The new SLTO crystallizes with hexagonal plate-shaped morphologies in the polar P3c1 space group (No. 158), as confirmed by Rietveld refinements of powder X-ray diffraction data and second harmonic generation activity. Full Sn(II) substitution was confirmed by 119Sn M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, SEM-EDS, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

The addition of cationic species, at sufficiently high concentrations, fractionates the colloids into a dark precipitate and a dispersible, colorless fraction.

However, incorporating fluorophores into scaffolds made from melt electrowriting (MEW) poses a challenge due to the sustained, elevated temperatures that this processing technique requires. In this context, we report that [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) serve as excellent fluorophores for MEW processing with the additional benefit of customizable emissions profiles with the same excitation wavelength. We use three fluorescent blends with distinct [n]CPPs with emission wavelengths of either 466 nm, 494 nm, or 533 nm, identifying 0.01 wt.% as the preferred concentration. We discover that [n]CPPs disperse well within poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) and maintain their fluorescence even after a week of continuous heating at 80\u00b0C. The [n]CPP-PCL blends show no cytotoxicity and support counterstaining with commonly used DAPI (Ex/Em: 359nm/457nm), rhodamine- (Ex/Em: 542/565 nm), and fluorescein-tagged (Ex/Em: 490/515 nm) phalloidin stains. Using different color [n]CPP-PCL blends, we sequentially deposit different MEW fibers into a semi-woven scaffold and onto a solution electrospun membrane containing [8]CPP as a contrasting substrate for the [10]CPP MEW fibers.

Here, we present a new strategy for DLP 3D printing of thermoplastics using two polymers with contrasting mechanical properties, where stiff and flexible linear polymers are sequentially constructed. The inks consist of two vinyl monomers, which lead to the stiff linear polymer, and \u03b1-lipoic acid to form the flexible linear polymer via thermal ring-opening polymerization in a second step. By varying the ratio of stiff and flexible polymers, the mechanical properties can be tuned with Young's modulus ranging from 1.1 GPa to 0.7 MPa, while the strain at break increased from 4% to 574%.

While derivatization-assisted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) remains the gold standard technique in lipidome, it mainly faces challenges in efficiently labeling carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) and differentiating isomeric lipids in full dimension. This presents the need for new orthogonal methodologies. Herein, a metal- and additive-free aza-Prilezhaev aziridination (APA)-enabled ion mobility mass spectrometric method is developed for probing multiple levels of unsaturated lipid isomerization with high-sensitivity. Both unsaturated polar and nonpolar lipids can be efficiently labeled in the form of N-H aziridine without significant side reactions. The signal intensity can be increased by up to three orders of magnitude, achieving nM detection limit. Abundant site-specific fragmentation ions indicate C=C location and sn-position in MS/MS spectra. Better yet, stable mono-aziridination product is dominant, simplifying the spectrum for lipids with multiple double bonds. Coupled with a U-shaped mobility analyzer, identification of geometric isomers and separation of different lipid classes can be achieved. Additionally, a unique pseudo MS3 mode with UMA-QTOF MS boosts the sensitivity for generating diagnostic fragments.

This investigation involves manipulating the cation identity (K+, Li+, and H+) and concentration at Au-water interfaces, which is carried out via the slow-growth sampling approach integrated with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our results demonstrate that the high local alkali metal cation (AM+) concentration facilitates CO2RR following the order of 2K+ > 1K+ > 2Li+ > 1Li+ > 0AM+, and the highly promoted CO2 activation kinetics originate from the short-range coordination between alkali metal cations and reaction intermediates.

Traditionally, MOF glasses are produced by heating MOF crystals to their melting point and then cooling the liquid MOF to room temperature under an inert atmosphere. While effective, this melt-quenching technique requires high energy due to the high temperatures involved. It also limits the scope of new material development by restricting the compositional range to only those combinations of metal ions and linkers that are highly thermally stable. An alternative, mechanical milling at room temperature, has demonstrated its capability to transform MOF crystals into amorphous phases. However, the specific conditions under which these amorphous phases exhibit glass-like behavior remain uncharted. In this study, we explore the mechanochemical amorphization and vitrification of a variety of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) at room temperature. These ZIFs feature diverse functionalized linkers and different metal ions (Zn2+, Co2+ and Cu2+). Through comprehensive analyses, including X-ray diffraction, calorimetry, and gas sorption studies, we gain valuable insights into the chemical and structural prerequisites and constraints for the mechanochemical vitrification of ZIFs. Our findings demonstrate that ZIFs capable of melting can be successfully converted into glasses through ball-milling. Remarkably, some non-meltable ZIFs can also be vitrified using the ball-milling technique, as highlighted by the preparation of the first Cu2+-based ZIF glass. This research significantly contributes to expanding the currently limited compositional range of MOF glasses.

Despite their numerous applications, highly reactive tetrazines can suffer from long-term instability and off-target reactivity, and achieving cell-specific bioconjugation remains challenging. Tetrazine caging techniques intend to overcome these issues by achieving spatial and temporal control over tetrazine activation from stable dihydrotetrazine derivatives. Here we explore enzyme-initiated tetrazine uncaging, allowing for controlled release of reactive tetrazines by enzymes overexpressed in specific cell types. Using a modular synthetic strategy, we connected four distinct enzyme-cleavable motifs to caged tetrazine derivatives using a self-immolative linker unit. We validated cell-specific release using penicillin G amidase (PGA), which we genetically encoded into HEK293Ts. Cells expressing PGA were able to activate tetrazines which subsequently reacted with a dienophile-protected doxorubicin, lowering viability. In contrast, treatment of mammalian cells lacking PGA showed no reduction in cell viability. Additionally, we generated enzyme-cleavable conjugates that are hydrolyzed by enzymes commonly exploited for drug delivery in human cells, including esterases, cathepsin B, and alkaline phosphatases. We demonstrate cell-type specific activation of tetrazines based on the varying expression levels of alkaline phosphatases in different cell lines. Specifically, we compared tetrazine activation in the osteosarcoma cell line SAOS-2, known for its exceptionally high ALP expression levels, to cells that express lower levels of ALP, the colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29 and the stromal cell line HS-5.

While the overwhelming majority of waltheriones are based on a quinoline core structure, two structurally simpler pyridone-based congeners, waltheriones S and T, have recently been isolated and found to inhibit Trypanosoma cruzi with single-digit micromolar potency. Here, we report on the synthesis of a series of analogs of waltheriones S and T based on pyridone ring formation via cyclization of an appropriate triketone precursor with ammonia and the assessment of their activity against Trypanosoma cruzi. The data show that the methoxy group at the C(3)-position of the pyridone ring can be removed without significant loss in potency. Further modification of 3-desmethoxy waltherione T through methoxylation at the C(1') position of the C(6)-side chain or double methoxylation at the C(1')-position and the pyridone nitrogen had no significant impact on antitrypanosomal activity. These findings contrast with the activity differences between the corresponding quinoline-based natural waltheriones M, Q, and H, where the methoxy-bearing waltheriones Q and H are one order of magnitude more potent than the unsubstituted parent compound waltherione M. Our data indicate that the SAR for monocyclic waltheriones S and T does not simply parallel that of the quinoline-based congeners and they point to the importance of a rigid quinoline core for potent activity against T. cruzi.

This study evinces the importance of ultrafast mixing and high heating rates for rapid nucleation, particularly in synthesizing monodispersed QDs with enriched surface defects. Recently, cerium oxide (CeO2) nanostructures have gained prominence in antioxidant therapy owing to the co-existence of Ce3+ and Ce4+. However, current batch processes lack scalability, reproducibility, and control over the reaction kinetics, key for fine-tuning the surface defect-driven properties of CeO2 nanostructures. Addressing this knowledge gap, we demonstrate a unique, sustainable, continuous flow platform that allows simultaneous engineering of surface oxygen vacancies (VO\u25cf) and regulates the size of L arginine functionalized CeO2 QDs (VO\u25cf-rich L-arg-CeO2 QDs).  Introduction of the helical coil reactor regulated by dean vortices yields monodispersed QDs with enhanced Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio and VO\u25cf at the surface. Through various experimental methodologies, we showed how adjusting temperature, flowrate, and pH enables achieving the desirable size (3 nm), thereby bestowing an optimal surface Ce3+ and VO\u25cf fractions, pivotal for size-dictated photo-response, physiochemical properties, and biofunctionality of the QDs. The abundant surface VO\u25cf (72%) entails narrowing of the band gap (~ 2.5 eV), resulting in unprecedented photothermal response (\u0394T = 19.7\u00b10.6\u00b0C) and photoluminescence, features not typically found in defect-free conventional CeO2 nanostructures.

Herein, we report on the synthesis and properties of soft and soluble N-methylated nylons as a novel class of soft polymer matter. Surprisingly, N-methylated nylons have scarcely been reported and are almost not registered with CAS SciFindern, while their unit structure is very simple. The N-methylation of nylons resulted in softness and high solubility by eliminating hydrogen bonds between polymer backbones and generating two conformers (cis and trans) of the tertiary amide group. Remarkably, some of them exhibit lower critical solution temperature (LCST)-type phase separation in water. By manipulating the carbon number within polymer backbones, we have found that the quantitative hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance for LCST is its unit formula per amide group equal to C6H11NO, which aligns with typical LCST polymers like poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM). Despite the structural similarity to PNIPAM, polymer scientists have never found LCST-type behavior of N-methylated nylons during over 50 years of soft polymer matter research.

The ever-increasing demand for complex fluorinated molecules has raised a significant interest to develop new synthetic methodologies that selectively introduce fluorine into molecular scaffolds.

Transition-metal-catalyzed fluorination reactions have been recognized as a promising tool in this context, but fundamental challenges, such as the very high energetic barriers associated with the formation of C\u2013F bonds by reductive elimination, amongst other reasons, remain to be addressed systematically. Arguably, research towards new concepts in fluorination chemistry should be conducted with substrates that are of immediate utility and imply a generalizability of the respective strategies.

Understanding the distinct material properties of fluids in such close confinement is critical for enhancing their performance in various applications. These properties dictate the fluid's behavior and play a crucial role in determining flow dynamics, transport processes, and, ultimately, the performance of nanoscale devices. Remarkably, many researchers observed that the size of the geometry, such as the diameter of the confining nanotube, exerts a profound and intriguing influence on the material properties of nanoconfined fluids, including on the critical parameters such as density, viscosity, and slip length. Many researchers tried to model these material properties: viscosity $\\eta$, density $\\rho$, and slip $\\lambda$ using various models with many dependencies on the tube diameter. It is somewhat confusing and tough to decide which model is appropriate and needs to be incorporated in the numerical simulation. In this paper, we tried to propose a simple single equation for each nano confined material property such as for density $\\displaystyle \\rho(D)/\\rho_o = a+ b/(D-c)^n$, viscosity $\\displaystyle \\eta(D)/\\eta_o  = a+ b/(D-c)^n$, and the slip length $\\lambda(D) = \\lambda_1~D~e^{-n~D}+ \\lambda_o$ (where $a,~b,~c,~n,~\\lambda_1,~\\lambda_o$ are the free fitting parameters). We model a wealth of previous experimental and MD simulation data from the literature using our proposed model for each material property of nanoconfined fluids at the nanometer and Angstrom scales. Our single proposed equation effectively captures and models all the data, even though many different models have been employed in the existing literature to describe the same material property.  Our proposed model exhibits exceptional agreement with multiple independent datasets from the experimental observations and molecular dynamics simulations.  Additionally, the model possesses the advantageous properties of continuity and a continuous derivative, so the proposed model is well-suited for integration into numerical simulations. Further, the proposed models also obey the far boundary conditions, i.e., when tube diameter $D \\implies \\infty$, the material properties tend to the bulk properties of the fluid. Due to the models' simplicity, smooth, and generic nature, this heuristic model holds promise to apply in simulations to design and optimize nanoscale devices.

Tree estimators, used due to limited data, rely on expert knowledge and manual construction currently, posing challenges in maintenance and improvement. In this work, we extend the subgraph isomorphic decision tree (SIDT) algorithm originally developed for rate estimation, to estimate HBI corrections. We introduce a physics-aware splitting criterion, explore a bounded weighted uncertainty estimation method, and evaluate aleatoric uncertainty-based and model variance reduction-based pre-pruning methods. Moreover, we compile a dataset of thermochemical parameters for 2,210 radicals involving C, O, and H based on quantum chemical calculations from recently published works.

The present work develops new GelMA-based bioinks using low concentrations of Carbopol (CBP) (0.1-0.5 wt%) as a rheology modifier. GelMA-CBP inks exhibit excellent rheological properties and outstanding printability at physiological temperatures (37 \u00baC) and at low GelMA concentrations (1\u20137 wt%). Complex constructs, including hollow structures with overhangs, were printed at 37 \u00baC with high shape fidelity using 0.5 wt% CBP. 3T3 fibroblasts embedded within structures 3D printed using GelMA-CBP bioinks exhibited > 90% cell viability for up to 14 days. GelMA-CBP bioinks also enabled the fabrication of a stretchable lung tissue model incorporating primary human lung fibroblasts to study fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition. This work solves the three key issues of GelMA-based bioinks for extrusion 3D bioprinting, by allowing the printing of complex constructs using i) low concentrations of GelMA, ii) low concentrations of a rheological modifier, and iii) physiological temperatures. Our work lays the foundation for using 3D printable GelMA materials in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and implantable medical device applications.", "date": "2024-01-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Biocompatible Materials; Biological Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Consistent with experimental observations, our CG simulations captured the formation of LLPS upon the addition of ATP and tendency of dissociating under high ionic concentration. The primary driving force behind this phenomenon is the electrostatic interaction between oligolysine and ATP. An in-depth analysis on the structural properties of LLPS was conducted, where the oligolysine structure remained unchanged with increased ionic concentration and the addition of ATP led to a more pronounced curvature, aligning with the observed enhancement of $\\alpha$-helical secondary structure in experiments. In terms of the dynamic properties, the introduction of ATP led to a significant reduction in translational and vibrational degrees of freedom but not rotational degrees of freedom. Through keeping the total number of charged residues constant and varying their entropic effects, we constructed two systems of similar biochemical significance and further validated the entropy effects on the LLPS formation.

This pathogenic bacterium exploits a sophisticated protein machinery called Iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) system to bind Hb, extract and internalize heme and finally degrade it to complete iron acquisition. IsdB, the surface exposed Hb receptor, is a proven virulence factor of S. aureus and the inhibition of its interaction with Hb can be pursued as a strategy to develop new classes of antimicrobials. To identify small molecules able to disrupt IsdB:Hb protein-protein interactions (PPIs), we carried out a structure-based virtual screening campaign and developed an ad-hoc immunoassay to screen the retrieved set of commercially available compounds. Saturation-transfer difference (STD) NMR was applied to verify specific interactions of a sub-set of molecules, chosen based on their efficacy in reducing the amount of Hb bound to IsdB. Among molecules for which direct binding was verified, the best hit was submitted to ITC analysis to measure the binding affinity to Hb, which was found to be in the sub-micromolar range.  The results demonstrate the viability of the proposed in silico/in vitro experimental pipeline to discover and test IsdB:Hb PPI inhibitors.

Our observations confirm that the first decomposition product, 2,6-dihydroxyanthrone (DHA), is stable but after electro-oxidative dimerization, the anthrone dimer decomposes. We identify conditions for which there is little time after dimerization until the dimer is rapidly re-oxidized electrochemically to form DHAQ.

Immobilizing the active Lewis sites to a solid support, especially to porous scaffolds, has shown great potential to ameliorate FLP catalysis by circumventing some of its inherent drawbacks, such as product separation and catalyst recyclability. Nevertheless, designing immobilized Lewis pair active sites (LPASs) is challenging due to the requirement of placing the donor and acceptor centers in appropriate geometric arrangements while maintaining the necessary chemical environment to perform catalysis, and clear design rules have not yet been established. In this work, we formulate simple guidelines to build highly active LPASs for direct catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 through a large-scale screening of a diverse library of 25,000 immobilized FLPs.  The library is built by introducing boron-containing acidic sites in the vicinity of the existing basic nitrogen sites of the organic linkers of metal-organic frameworks collected in a ``top-down\" fashion from an experimental database. The chemical and geometrical appropriateness of these LPASs for CO2 hydrogenation is determined by evaluating a series of simple descriptors representing the intrinsic strength (acidity and basicity) of the components and their spatial arrangement in the active sites. Analysis of the leading candidates enables the formulation of pragmatic and experimentally-relevant design principles and the leading candidates constitute the starting point for further exploration of FLP-based catalysts for the reduction of CO2.

These materials have the potential to overcome the fabrication complexities inherent in conventional III-V semiconductors by circumventing the necessity for lattice-matching, instead allowing for straightforward deposition of polycrystalline films without relying on metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. However, achieving shorter emission wavelengths presents a significant challenge due to the larger bandgaps required of both the perovskite and charge transport materials, compounding the difficulty in managing electron-hole pair recombination dynamics necessary for efficient electroluminescence. In this work, we address these challenges by precisely tuning the halide composition in two-dimensional perovskites, successfully extending the bandgap to 3.1 eV and achieving photoluminescent emission at 393 nm. By introducing an optimized dual electron transport layer architecture, we improve electron injection and hole confinement within the perovskite matrix, culminating in a high-purity electroluminescent emission at 399 nm. This strategy yields a maximum external quantum efficiency of 0.16%, a new benchmark for PeLEDs operating in this spectral domain.

This insight prompts the development of two innovative in situ techniques. The first technique capitalizes on discernible voltage signature differences between quinone, and quinone-CO2 adducts. By incorporating a reference electrode into the carbon capture cell setup, we apply this method to investigate bis[3-(trimethylammonio)propyl]-anthraquinones (BTMAPAQs).

Thus, we introduce a non-invasive, in situ approach using fluorescence microscopy, providing the unique capability to distinguish between oxidized, reduced, and adduct species with sub-second time resolution at single digit micrometer resolution.

Rapid micromixing occurs because the dissipated energy leads to a substantial reduction in the initial segregation size scale of the liquids, which is the single-sheet thickness at impingement (~ 100 \u03bcm). In the present study, the micromixing was investigated by following the progress of an acid-base neutralization accompanied by a change in fluorescence intensity of a fluorophore. Micromixing was modeled using a framework that assumes diffusion and reaction of species occur within slabs of fixed thickness (2L). The slabs are fixed in size because the released kinetic energy is dissipated within one turnover time of the large energy-containing eddies produced in the turbulent impingement zone. A simulation, which included a module for calculating the fluorescence intensity, determined 2L for experimental energy dissipation rates ranging from 40,000 to 7,700,000 W/kg. 2L was found to lie in the range of turbulent dissipative scales less than the Taylor microscale but greater than the Kolmogorov microscale. 2L is a function of the energy dissipation rate, kinematic viscosity, large-eddy Reynolds number and fluctuating turbulent velocity.

Thus, extending our previous work on the hydrophobicity scale of amino acids. To this end, we employed two structural models, named Model 1 and 2, differentiated solely by their C-terminal capping groups using an N- or O- methyl substituent, respectively. Our findings revealed substantial similarities between the models, validating the lipophilicity values for the non-standard side chains.

The CPP mechanism is far from comprehensively understood, mainly due to the limited examples of efficient triplet emission from small chiral organic molecules with well-defined structures. Herein, a pair of chiral enantiomers R/S-BBTI is reported, featuring the highly distorted spiral ring-locked heteroaromatics with heavy iodine atoms. These chiral molecules emit NIR phosphorescence and exhibit considerable high dissymmetry factors up to 0.013 with an efficiency of 4.2% and a lifetime of 119 \u03bcs in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution after ultraviolet irradiation. Their crystals show efficient CPP with 7.0% quantum efficiency and a lifetime of 166 \u03bcs. Extensive experimental chiroptical investigations combined with theoretical calculations reveal an efficient spin-flip process that modulates the electron and magnetic transition dipole moments to enhance CPP performance. Moreover, the phosphorescence of R/S-BBTI is oxygen-sensitive and photoactivated in DMSO. Therefore, R/S-BBTI can be applied for hypoxia imaging in cells and tumors, expanding the scope of CPP applications.", "date": "2024-04-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Using ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS), we aim to reveal these early steps of aggregation for the Ac-PHF6-NH2 peptide segment from tau protein, thereby distinguishing between different oligomeric species, and gaining an understanding of the aggregation pathway. An important factor that is often neglected, but which can alter the aggregation propensity of peptides, is the terminal capping groups. Here we demonstrate the use of IM-MS to probe the early stages of aggregate formation of the Ac-PHF6-NH2, Ac-PHF6, PHF6-NH2, and uncapped PHF6 peptide segments. The aggregation propensity of the four PHF6 segments is confirmed using thioflavin T fluorescence assays and transmission electron microscopy. Post-IM fragmentation and quadrupole selection on the TIMS-Qq-ToF (trapped ion mobility) spectrometer are introduced to improve oligomer assignment. In addition, TIMS collision cross section values are compared with travelling wave ion mobility (TWIMS) data to evaluate potential instrumental bias in the trapped ion mobility results.

Often, pure metal oxides show low activity in photocatalytic H2O2 production and therefore metal co-catalysts are required to improve the photoactivity. This work investigated photocatalytic H2O2 production using monodisperse gold nanoclusters Au101(PPh3)21Cl5 supported on WO3. From HRTEM imaging, the Au101 size in the uncalcined samples is in the cluster regime (<2 nm) and after calcination at 200 \u00b0C the size increases to ca. 4.5 nm. The roles of Au101 have been identified to reduce the charge carrier recombination and provide the active sites for O2 reduction which significantly enhances the photoactivity. Both uncalcined and calcined Au101/WO3 photocatalysts produce over 75 mM g-1 h-1 of H2O2 under UV light irradiation while the pure WO3 is inactive. At early times (up to 30 min), the production rate of H2O2 from calcined Au101/WO3 reaches 173 mM g-1 h-1 and is almost double the rate of the uncalcined catalyst (93 mM g-1 h-1). The higher photoactivity of calcined versus uncalcined Au101/WO3 can be attributed to the aggregated Au101 and removal of phosphine ligands from the Au core as verified by HRTEM and XPS. The reaction rate decreases over time which is attributed to the reverse reaction. Using a simple kinetic model, the rate constant of the H2O2 formation (kf) for uncalcined and calcined Au101/WO3 are 2.07 and 6.31 mM h-1, while the rate constant of the H2O2 decomposition (kd) for uncalcined and calcined Au101/WO3 are 0.49 and 2.93 h-1, respectively. This work highlights a simple preparation of highly active photocatalysts to produce H2O2 derived from Au101 clusters and WO3.", "date": "2024-01-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Photocatalysis; Chemical Kinetics; Clusters; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study we consider how information flows through the auxilary density operators (ADOs) in the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). We consider three cases for a range of baths,underdamped, intermediate and overdamped. By understanding how information flows, we are able to determine the relative importance of different ADOs within the hierarchy. We show that ADOs sharing a common Matsubara axis behave similarly while ADOs on different Matsubara axes behave differently. Using this knowledge we are able to truncate hierarchies significantly, thus reducing computation time, while obtaining qualitatively similar results. This is illustrated by comparing 2D electronic spectra for a molecule with an underdamped vibration subsumed into the bath spectral density.

Today, numerous strategies expand GEL beyond 20AA space by incorporating unnatural amino acids (UAA) and chemical post-translational modification (cPTM) to build linear, cyclic, and bicyclic peptides. The standard operating procedure for UAA and cPTM libraries starts from a \"na\u00efve\" chemically-upgraded library with 108-1012 compounds, uses target of interest and rounds of selection to narrow down to a set of receptor binding hits.

The re-shaping is performed under a novel multifunctional C2-symmetric linchpin, 3,5-bis(bromomethyl)benzaldehyde (termed KYL), that combines two electrophiles that react with thiols and aldehyde group that reacts with N-terminal amine. KYL diversified phage-displayed peptides into bicyclic architectures and delineates 2 distinct sequence populations: (i) peptides that retained binding upon bicyclization (ii) peptides that lost binding once chemically modified. Our report provides a case study for discovering advanced, chemically-upgraded macrocycles and bicycles from libraries with pre-existing knowledge.

The corresponding transitions were spectroscopically observed, as were transitions related to the exchange coupling in the dinuclear complex, ensuring robustness of the electronic structure analysis. Finally, clear signatures of spin\u2013phonon coupling were observed and theoretically analyzed in detail, revealing modulation of off-diagonal elements of the dynamic ZFS to be the main coupling elements, corresponding to local rotations of the ZFS tensors. Furthermore, we conclusively demonstrate that the spectral features are not predominantly spin excitations, but largely vibrational in character.", "date": "2024-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Spectroscopy (Inorg.); Theory - Inorganic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here, a comparative study of the photophysical and optoelectronic properties of two cyclophane emitters, (1,7)tBuCzpPhTrz and its isomer (1,4)tBuCzpPhTrz, is presented. The carbazolophane-triazine compound (1,7)tBuCzpPhTrz, obtained via an unprecedented intramolecular rearrangement, is the first example of a planar chiral TADF emitter deviating from the PCP scaffold. Significant geometrical change of the enclosed carbazole in (1,7)tBuCzp results in an attenuation of the donor strength, while the merits of rigidity and steric bulk remain. In particular, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the photoluminescence spectrum in toluene of (1,7)tBuCzpPhTrz is reduced by 34% and blue-shifted by 20 nm compared to that of (1,4)tBuCzpPhTrz.

However, the emission peaks of the reported chiral OIHMHs mainly locate in the visible region, and chiral OIHMH with ultraviolet (UV) circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has been rarely reported. To fill this gap, cerium, a unique rare-earth (RE) element with tunable luminescence from UV to the visible region owing to the 4f-related electronic transition, was introduced to construct the first RE-based chiral OIHMHs, R/S-MCC. The chirality is successfully transferred from the chiral organic cations to the inorganic cerium chloride framework in R/S-MCC, as confirmed by the single crystal structures, circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence. The emission spectra of R/S-MCC are in the UV region, originating from the characteristic d-f transition of Ce3+, which making the Ce-based metal halides are ideal candidates towards CPL light sources in the UV region. Notably, R/S-MCC are the first RE-based OIHMHs, also the first chiral metal-halides with UV CPL. Our work opens a new avenue for the development of the chiral OIHMH family towards RE-based chiral OIHMH.

IM measurement provides collision cross section (CCS) values that facilitate analyte identification. While CCS values can be directly calculated from mobility measurements obtained using drift tube ion mobility spectrometry (DT-IMS), this method has limited mobility resolution due to the practical constraints on the length of the ion drift path. Consequently, DT-IMS cannot differentiate analytes with similar mobilities or resolve fine mobility features of individual ions. Cyclic IMS (cIMS) instruments leverage a cyclic path enabled by traveling wave ion mobility (TWIM) technology and offer increased mobility solution to address this challenge. While TWIM devices must first be calibrated to enable CCS measurements, current calibration strategies are primarily tailored for single-pass analyses. This preference is partly attributed to the challenges associated with multi-pass calibration methods, which require both calibrants and analytes to experience the same number of passes. Achieving this consistency can be complicated due to factors like peak splitting and diffusion, and may not be feasible for on-line IM-MS analyses. A recent report employed average ion velocities obtained from multiple measurements under different separation pathlengths as a pathlength-independent metric for CCS calibration. However, the ability to exploit this averaging approach is limited by observed variation in ion drift time/velocity in these measurements. In this study, we introduce a novel calibration strategy designed for multi-pass cIMS analyses, directly targeting the root cause for the pathlength- and mobility-dependent variations in ion drift time. With this method, we demonstrate that CCS values derived from multi-pass measurements closely align with those obtained from single-pass analyses, with an average deviation of 0.1%. We apply this method to characterize four isomeric trisaccharides. Our approach not only results in excellent agreement between our measured cIMSCCS values and the reported DTCCS values, with an average difference of only 0.5%, but also allows us to effectively identify subtle mobility characteristics of each compound and determine their respective CCS values. This level of detail and accuracy was previously unattainable using DT-IMS or single-pass cIMS measurements. We developed an algorithm for reconstructing arrival time distribution in cases where wrap-around has resulted in peak splitting. Collectively, the new calibration strategy and the reconstruction procedure maintain reproducibility and precision in CCS measurements while largely eliminating the need for meticulous selection of separation times. We expect that our method will empower researchers to harness the high mobility resolution offered by multi-pass cIMS analyses without compromising the accuracy of CCS measurement, making it appropriate for straightforward use across a wide range of applications.", "date": "2024-02-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

After excitation of an electron from n to \u03c0*, a (4n+2)\u03c0-electron species has 2n+2 \u03c0(alpha)-electrons and 2n+1 \u03c0(beta)-electrons (or vice versa), and becomes \u03c0(alpha)-antiaromatic and \u03c0(beta)-aromatic. Yet, the antiaromatic \u03c0(alpha)- and aromatic \u03c0(beta)-components seldom cancel, leading to residuals with aromatic or antiaromatic character. We explore vertically excited triplet n,\u03c0* states (3n,\u03c0*), which are most readily analyzed, but also singlet n,\u03c0* states (1n,\u03c0*), and explain which compounds have n,\u03c0* states with aromatic residuals as their lowest excited states (e.g., pyrazine and the phenyl anion). If the \u03c0-electron population becomes more (less) uniformly distributed upon excitation, the system will have an (anti-)aromatic residual. Among isomers, the one which has the most aromatic residual in 3n,\u03c0* is often of lowest energy in this state.

Stable methanol space-time-yield (STY) of 12.8 mmol/gcat/h and methanol selectivity of 89.5 % are simultaneously achieved at a relatively low reaction temperature of 513 K, making Cu@FAU a potential methanol synthesis catalyst from CO2 hydrogenation.

It is often recognized that these end-point techniques serve as an option of intermediate accuracy and computational cost compared with more rigorous statistical mechanic models (e.g., alchemical transformation) and coarser molecular docking. However, it is observed that this intermediate level of accuracy does not hold in relatively simple and prototypical host-guest systems. Specifically, in our previous work investigating a set of carboxylated-pillar[6]arene host-guest complexes, end-point methods provide free energy estimates deviating significantly from the experimental reference, and the rank of binding affinities is also incorrectly computed. These observations suggest the unsuitability and inapplicability of standard end-point free energy techniques in host-guest systems, and alteration and development are required to make them practically usable. In this work, we consider two ways to improve the performance of end-point techniques. The first one is the PBSA_E regression that varies the weights of different free energy terms in the end-point calculation procedure, while the second one is considering the interior dielectric constant as an additional variable in the end-point equation. By detailed investigation of the calculation procedure and the simulation outcome, we prove that these two treatments (i.e., regression and dielectric constant) are manipulating the end-point equation in a somehow similar way, i.e., weakening the electrostatic contribution and strengthening the non-polar terms, although there are still many detailed differences between these two methods. With the trained end-point scheme, the RMSE of the computed affinities is improved from the standard ~12 kcal/mol to ~2.4 kcal/mol, which is comparable to another altered end-point method (ELIE) trained with system-specific data. This phenomenon along with the extremely efficient optimized-structure computation procedure suggests the regression (i.e., PBSA_E as well as its GBSA_E extension) as a practically applicable solution that brings end-point methods back into the library of usable tools for host-guest binding. However, the dielectric-constant-variable scheme cannot effectively minimize the experiment-calculation discrepancy for absolute binding affinities, but is able to improve the calculation of affinity ranks. This phenomenon is somehow different from the protein-ligand case and suggests the difference between host-guest and biomacromolecular (protein-ligand and protein-protein) cases. Therefore, the spectrum of tools usable in protein-ligand cases could be unsuitable for host-guest binding, and numerical validations are necessary to screen out really workable solutions in these \u2018prototypical\u2019 situations.

Currently, both fundamental and applied magnetic resonance are enjoying a major boost owing to the dramatic signal enhancement provided by the rapidly-developing field of spin hyperpolarization. Such techniques are able to enhance signal intensities in magnetic resonance by several orders of magnitude, and thus to largely overcome its major disadvantage of relatively low sensitivity compared to other analytical techniques. This provides new impetus for existing applications, and, even more importantly, this opens the gates to numerous novel and exciting possibilities in the broad fields of fundamental and applied magnetic resonance. There are many different techniques that fall under the umbrella term \u201chyperpolarization\u201d. Existing reviews cover the various subfields, but they are mostly addressed separately, and are seldom perceived as integral parts of the same field. In this review we attempt to unify the many methods that are used to hyperpolarize nuclear spins into one picture. Specifically, before delving into the individual techniques, we provide a detailed analysis of the underlying principles of spin hyperpolarization. We attempt to uncover and classify the origins of hyperpolarization; to establish its sources and the specific mechanisms that enable the flow of polarization from a source to the target nuclear spins. After outlining the inner workings of hyperpolarization, we give a more detailed analysis of individual hyperpolarization techniques: the mechanisms by which they work, fundamental and technical requirements, characteristic applications, unresolved issues and possible future directions. While a substantial progress has been achieved in the field of spin hyperpolarization in recent years, the continuing growth of activity indicates that this is just the beginning. It is unlikely that fundamentally new sources of hyperpolarization will be uncovered in the near future, but we expect the field to flourish as new ways to improve and utilize current hyperpolarization techniques are identified and implemented. There is great scope for cross-fertilization between known methods, and developments in one area (e.g., prolonging polarization lifetimes, or creating more efficient excitation-detection schemes) can have a very broad impact across the entire field of hyperpolarization. We hope this review will facilitate this process, since advances in hyperpolarization will help to overcome existing challenges in magnetic resonance and enable novel applications.", "date": "2022-08-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Anal.

The closest form of a design equation comes from Lee and Liu\u2019s (LL) 1980 colloid filtration theory, which considers inertial impaction as a method of drop capture. This work compares the LL framework to two additional colloid filtration theories. The first one is Rajagopalan and Tien\u2019s (RT) 1976 theory, which considers inertial impaction and the detachment of a captured drop due to shear conditions. The second theory is a modified form of the RT framework that includes the coalescence probability (RTCP) between captured drops and drops in the incoming flow.  For pad coalescers, the LL, RT, and RTCP theories were compared in terms of the predicted bed length for various combinations of superficial velocities (q) and bed porosities (\u03b5_o). In the typical design range for \u201cq\u201d (0.6 - 3 cm/s), the three frameworks produce similar packed bed lengths. However, only RTCP can be used for high and low \u201cq\u201d values. The RTCP framework was also the only one capable of reproducing the recommended industrial practice for the design of cartridge coalescers. The RTCP framework was also used in a case study for the dewatering of diluted bitumen froth. A fibrous bed coalescer was sized to remove emulsified water from diluted bitumen extracted from the oil sands in the Canadian Athabasca region. The manufacturer-recommended \u201cq\u201d range of 0.6 - 3 cm/s was the most reasonable because higher \u201cq\u201d values produced larger pressure drops in the coalescer and a substantial increase in the size of the gravity separator.

Notably, these approaches often fail to differentiate between isomeric lipids - a challenge that is particularly acute for branched-chain fatty acids (FAs) that often share similar (or identical) mass spectra to their straight-chain isomers. Here, we utilize charge-switching strategies that combine ligated magnesium dications with deprotonated fatty acid anions. Subsequent activation of these charge inverted anions yields mass spectra that differentiate anteiso branched- from straight-chain and iso branched-chain FA isomers with the predictable fragmentation enabling de novo assignment of anteiso branch points. Application of these charge-inversion chemistries in both gas- and solution-phase modalities is demonstrated to assign the position of anteiso-methyl branch-points in FAs, and can be extended to de novo assignment of additional branching sites via predictable fragmentation patterns as methyl branching site(s) move closer to the carboxyl carbon. The gas phase approach is shown to be compatible with top-down structure elucidation of complex lipids such as phosphatidylcholines, while integration of solution-phase charge-inversion with reversed phase liquid chromatography enables separation and unambiguous identification of FA structures within isomeric mixtures. Taken together, the presented charge switching MS-based technique, in combination with liquid chromatography enables the structural identification of branched-chain FA without the requirement of authentic methyl branched FA reference standards.

Enzymatic catalysis promotes enantioselective syntheses operating under mild condi-tions of temperature and pressure. The process, however, requires elevated times of reactions and the use of high-cost immobilized derivatives. These consequences usually become obstacles to industrial application of such syntheses. Using of ultrasound and microwaves as alternative heat-ing sources in the enzymatic catalysis, it is possible to overcome these problems besides leading to satisfactory yields and allowing the reduction of solvent volume. In this work, esterification reactions of oleic acid were performed to obtain xylitol monooleate by using alternative method-ologies which agree with the precepts of green chemistry.

Chromium (Cr3+) is a toxic metal and carcinogenic but its complexation with few ligands proves them to be a potential therapeutic agent. Cr3+ complexes with amino acid derivatives showed antimicrobial activity against different bacterial species. Antibiotics with ceftriaxone with metal complexes showed good antimicrobial properties. The complex of metals with 4-hydroxypyridine and azide ion Zn2+ complex with tridentate ligand showed low antibacterial but high antifungal properties.\nThe movement of Cr3+ in living organisms depends considerably on the complexation of the metal center by chelating nitrogen donor ligands. Cr3+ cysteine and hydrazide complexes, on the other hand, have noticeable antibacterial and antifungal activities. Sulfonamides, Sulfanilamide derivatives, and cephapirin with Cr3+ complexes showed good antimicrobial properties.

Permeability data for water and oxygen through epoxy-based coatings are of particular interest because the coating\u2019s barrier performance in humid environments is directly related to how quickly these reactants get to the metal/coating interface. There is, however, an absence of literature data to explain oxygen transport within coatings in the presence of condensed water and its associated plasticization effects. We show that water is a dominant player in the barrier performance of epoxy coatings because it blocks the transport of other permeants. Through analysis of the sorption isotherms and empirical permeation data, we determined adjustable parameters that explain water vapor plasticization effects in fusion bonded epoxy (FBE) at 65\u00b0C. At this temperature, evolution of cavity formation and break-up of water clusters result in high mobility of water molecules inside the epoxy network. We also modeled oxygen transport through FBE in wet-state conditions based on time lag measurements, and with reported literature data on vapor and gas sorption in epoxy. In a mixed gas/vapor system, condensed water in FBE blocks and/or significantly decreases gas permeation in the coating. If the service temperature is low (less than 40\u00b0C), water immobilizes the oxygen gas within microvoid regions in the glassy epoxy. Our experimental measurements, combined with Freeman\u2019s theoretical model for upper bound limits, showed that this water-induced blocking mechanism is sufficient to suppress corrosion reactions on the underlying substrate material. At 65\u00b0C and above, the synergistic effect of coating plasticization by water molecules and dissolution of oxygen in a mobile water phase results in significant gaseous transport. We applied mathematical models based on proven sorption and transport models to FBE free-standing films and derived adjustable parameters to quantitatively explain this competitive permeation. Our O2 transport data show that, compared to the single-layer FBE, epoxy-based coatings with additional polyolefin layers can improve the barrier performance by deprivation of micropore channels for gas transport.", "date": "2022-08-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Coating Materials; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

An everlasting challenge in realizing full-spectrum CPL detection when using chiral organic semiconductors is to achieve strong chiroptical activities in the near infrared (NIR) region. The conventional approaches to reducing the band gap of organic semiconductors are based on co-planar backbones and lead to molecular symmetries incompatible with the presence of chirality; thus, the strategies to design chiral molecules rely on twisted stereogenic moieties. Here, instead of a de novo design of chiral molecular structures, we introduce a widely applicable strategy to directly induce chiroptical activity in planar non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), which have been largely developed in the framework of organic photovoltaics and provide a wealth of opportunities to fill the spectral gap of CPL detection in the NIR. We demonstrate proof-of-concept circularly polarized organic photodiodes (CP-OPDs) using chiroptically active NFA blends, which exhibit strong circular dichroism (CD) and hence great sensitivity to CPL in the NIR region. Importantly, this strategy is found to be effective in a wide series of state-of-the-art NFA families, i.e., ITIC, o-IDTBR, and Y6 analogs, which significantly broadens the range of materials applicable to NIR CPL detection and can inspire further designs of strongly CPL-active systems for chiropto-electronics.", "date": "2022-08-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Materials Processing; Optical Materials; Thin Films; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Despite the plethora of systems developed that differ in metal/ligand identity, no studies establish how variation of the metal impacts the pertinent thermochemical properties of the catalyst, namely the equilibrium with H2, the hydricity of the resulting hydride, and the acidity of the ligand. These parameters can impact the kinetics, scope, and mechanism of catalysis and hence should be established. Herein, we describe how changing the metal (Co, Fe, Mn, Ru) and charge (neutral vs. anionic) impacts these parameters in a series of PNP-ligated catalysts (PNP = 2,6-bis[(di-tert-butylphosphino)methyl]pyridine). A linear correlation between hydricity and ligand pKa (when bound to the metal) is found, indicating that the two parameters are not independent of one another. This trend holds across four metals, two charges, and two different types of ligand (amine/amide and aromatization/dearomatization). Moreover, the effect of ligand deprotonation on the hydricity of (PNP)(CO)(H)Fe-H and (PNP)(CO)(H)Ru-H is assessed. It is determined that deprotonation to give anionic hydride species enhances the hydricity by ~ 16.5 kcal\u00b7mol-1 across three metals. Taken together, this work suggests that the metal identity has little effect on the thermodynamic parameters for PNP-ligated systems that undergo MLC via (de)aromatization, whilst the effect of charge is significant; moreover, ion-pairing allows for further tuning of the hydricity values.

To design and understand the performance of DACs for electrocatalysis, ab initio calculations have been widely employed. However, most previous theoretical studies used a pristine dual-atom site to analyze the electrocatalytic activity of a DAC. Herein, by analyzing M-M\u2019-Nx-C DAC structures (where M, N, and C represent the metal, nitrogen, and carbon, respectively) with ab initio calculations, our derived surface Pourbaix diagrams show that the surface states of DACs generally differ from a pristine surface at electrocatalytic operating conditions, due to the strong adsorption capacity of a DAC\u2019s unique metal-metal bridge site. This phenomenon suggests that the surface state of a DAC should be considered before analyzing the catalytic activity in electrocatalysis, while the electrochemistry-driven pre-adsorbed molecules generated from the liquid phase may either change the electronic properties or even block the active site of DACs. Based on these results, we add a critical comment to the DAC community: before analyzing the electrocatalytic activity of a DAC, its surface state should be analyzed beforehand.", "date": "2022-08-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Surface", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have the potential to capture the complex interactions determining how charged biomolecules interact with membranes, but systematic overbinding of sodium and calcium cations in standard MD simulations raises the question of how accurately force fields capture the interactions between lipid membranes and charged biomolecules. Here, we evaluate the binding of positively charged small molecules, etidocaine and tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP), to a POPC lipid bilayer using the changes in lipid headgroup order parameters.

Our results can be explained by distinct binding mechanisms of charged small molecules with hydrophobic moieties and monoatomic ions. The binding of the former is driven by hydrophobic effects, while the latter has direct electrostatic interactions with lipids.

The elucidation of atomistic structure is impeded, both experimentally and computationally, by structural disorder, presenting a huge challenge for designing functional amorphous materials. Amorphous materials may be characterised through their local atomic arrangements using, for example, solid-state NMR and X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). By using these two spectroscopy methods to inform the sampling of configurations from ab initio molecular dynamics we devise and validate an amorphous model, choosing amorphous alumina to illustrate the approach due to its wide range of technological uses. Our model predicts two distinct geometric arrangements of AlO5 coordination polyhedra and determines the origin of the pre-edge features in the Al K-edge XAS. We finally construct an average electronic density of states for amorphous alumina, and identify localized states at the conduction band minimum (CBM). We show that the CBM is comprised of Al 3s states and connect this localization and the presence of the pre-edge in the XAS. Deconvoluting this XAS by coordination geometry reveals contributions from both AlO4 and AlO5 geometries at the CBM give rise to the pre-edge, which provides insight into the role of AlO5 in the electronic structure of alumina.

The reaction mechanisms behind the selectivity towards acetate vs. other C2 products remain controversial. In this work, we elucidate the reaction mechanism towards acetate by using ab-initio simulations, a coupled kinetic-transport model, and loading experiments. We find that trends in acetate selectivity can be rationalized from variations in electrolyte pH and the local mass transport properties of the catalyst and not from changes of Cu's intrinsic activity. The selectivity mechanism originates in the transport of ketene, a stable (closed shell) intermediate, away from the \ncatalyst surface into solution where it reacts to acetate.

However, since asymmetric salt concentrations affect the electrophoretic pull inside and outside the pore differently, it also offers a useful control parameter to elucidate the otherwise inseparable physics of the capture and translocation process. In this work, we attempt to paint a complete picture of the dynamics of polymer capture and translocation in both symmetric and asymmetric salt concentration conditions by reporting the dependence of multiple translocation metrics on voltage, polymer length, and salt concentration gradient. Using asymmetric salt concentration conditions, we experimentally observe the predictions of tension propagation theory, and infer the significant impact of the electric field outside the pore in capturing polymers and in altering polymer conformations prior to translocation.", "date": "2022-08-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Nanoscience; Biopolymers; Nanodevices; Nanofluidics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Such billion-molecule libraries can never be fully synthesized, tested, or even stored. The only way to explore this expanded chemical space is by computationally prioritizing particular molecules for synthesis and testing, often by docking. The success of this prioritization may depend on library properties: how diverse are the molecules, how similar are they to bio-like molecules, such as metabolites and drugs, how does receptor-fit improve with library size, and how does the presence of artifacts grow with library size? To begin to investigate these questions, we compare the characteristics and performance of a library of 3 million \u201cin-stock\u201d molecules with that of ever-larger tangible libraries, up to 3 billion molecules in size. The bias toward biologically precedented molecules of the 886-fold larger tangible library decreases 19,000-fold compared to the in-stock library. Looking at docking hits, and not the overall libraries, thousands of high-ranking synthesized and tested tangible compounds from five ultra-large library docking campaigns are also dissimilar to bio-like molecules. These observations imply that bio-likeness plays little role in the likelihood of binding, appearing to contradict multiple studies to the contrary. Another important aspect of library growth is whether screening ever-larger libraries leads to better ligands. Judged by docking score, better fitting molecules are found as the library grows, with score improving log-linearly with library size. Finally, it is possible to imagine that as library size increases, so too do the chances of rare events\u2014molecules that cheat the scoring function and rank artifactually well.  Both simulation and experimental results from ultra-large library screens suggest that this is true\u2014as the libraries grow, more and more artifacts can crowd the very top-ranking molecules.  Although the nature of these artifacts appears to change from target to target, the expectation of their occurrence does not, and simple strategies may be devised to minimize the impact of these rare-event artifacts on the success of large library screens.", "date": "2022-08-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We develop the methodology using O3 and Cl2 mixtures (representative of an important class of analytes) and LCs supported on metal perchlorate-decorated surfaces as a model system.  Whereas O3 and Cl2\u00ac both diffuse through LC films and undergo redox reactions with the supporting metal perchlorate surfaces to generate similar initial and final optical states of the LCs, we show that a 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) can extract feature information that is encoded in the spatiotemporal color patterns of the LCs to detect the presence of both O3 and Cl2 species in mixtures as well as to quantify their concentrations. Our analysis reveals that O3 detection is driven by the transition time over which the brightness of the LC changes, while Cl2 detection is driven by color fluctuations that develop late in the optical response of the LC. We also show that we can detect the presence of Cl2 even when the concentration of O3 is orders of magnitude greater than the Cl2 concentration.

Subsequently, 11 typical MLSFs were evaluated using random cross-validation (Random-CV), protein sequence similarity-based cross-validation (Seq-CV), and pocket Pfam-based cross-validation (Pfam-CV) methods. Surprisingly, all of the tested models showed decreased performances from Random-CV to Seq-CV to Pfam-CV experiments, not showing satisfactory generalization capacity.

Herein, an approach to protein modification is described that relies on a photoredox method for the site-selective bioconjugation of phenylalanine. This methodology has been validated on peptides as well as protein insulin using a straightforward and mild condition. In addition, based on characterization by near-UV CD spectroscopy and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), this pyrazole labeling approach permitted the insulin hexamer to completely dissociate into the monomeric form, thus making it a potential candidate for use as rapid-acting insulin for the treatment of diabetes.", "date": "2022-11-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Catalysis; Chemical Biology; Photocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The DNA fluid was fabricated through the self-assembly of branched DNA motifs, nanostructures of base-paired single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs): Three ssDNAs hybridized in the stem region to form a branched motif possessing sticky ends (SEs); via the hybridization of SEs, the branched DNA motifs self-assembled into DNA fluid, which was micrometer-scale condensates. The motifs were equipped with a photoresponsive capability by introducing azobenzene (Azo), well-studied photoisomerizable compound44, in the SEs. The photoswitchable Azo isomerization enabled the reversible association/dissociation between branched DNA motifs, leading to photoreversible fluidity regulation via gel\u2013liquid\u2013dispersed state transition. To design an energy-transducing system, we exploited the following sequence-specific programmability of DNA. By cross-linking the photoresponsive DNA motif with a branched DNA motif possessing nonphotoresponsive orthogonal SEs, we achieved photocontrollable \u201ctransporter\u201d DNA and \u201ccargo\u201d DNA fluids; the photoresponsive DNA fluid hydrodynamically performed mechanical actions upon the nonphotoresponsive DNA fluid by transducing light energy. Notably, we discovered multiple modes in the generated fluid\u2019s mechanical action as a function of the applied temperature and the Azo insertion site in the SE. Each flow mode was characterized as a single-peak-shaped profile in the temperature-dependent flow mobilities. The highest and lowest mobilities were obtainable in moderate and lower and higher temperature ranges, respectively. This anomalous profile was analogous to the reentrant phase behavior of DNA microstructures41,50,51, which behave as solid-like only in a moderate temperature range and as liquid-like in the lower and higher temperature ranges. Following thermodynamic arguments on the observed reentrancy, we describe the observed flow-mobility behavior as a manifestation of a transient non-equilibrium state in the SEs binding stability. We also explain the mode-changeability of the mechanical actions with experimental support by explaining the role of the Azo insertion site in the SE in determining the degree of the nonequilibrium in the binding stability.", "date": "2022-08-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Polymer Science; Biophysical Chemistry; Self-Assembly; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Understanding electrode reaction kinetics is crucial for improving RFB performance and lowering costs.

Here, in situ X-ray total scattering experiments were performed during the hydrothermal synthesis of wolframite-type MWO4 (M: Mn, Fe, Co, Ni), enabling pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of the process. Upon mixing of the aqueous precursors, a crystalline precursor formed for the MnWO4 synthesis, while amorphous pastes formed for the FeWO4, CoWO4 and NiWO4 syntheses. Upon heating, the crystalline MnWO4 precursor converted directly to a crystalline wolframite-type MnWO4 phase, while the amorphous precursor led to the formation of an intermediate phase before the crystalline tungstates. The structure of the amorphous precursors was studied in detail using PDF analysis. Database mining was initially used to extract chemically relevant cluster structures, with the conclusion that the structure of the precursor contains Keggin fragments, well known from polyoxometalate chemistry. Such fragments are present in the Tourn\u00e9 \u2018sandwich\u2019 cluster, which has previously been found to be involved in the formation of some tungstates. We then used our recently developed ML-MotEx algorithm to identify which structural motifs in the sandwich structure are important to obtain a good fit of the data throughout the reaction. This analysis led to the identification of a skewed sandwich cluster to best describe the amorphous precursor structures. For the intermediate phase, ML-MotEx favoured motifs found both in the precursor and product phases, and the PDF of the intermediate phase could be described up to 20 \u00c5 by a disordered MWO4 structure. We found that the more disordered the precursor phase is, the longer reaction time is required to form crystalline products.

This study aims to validate this claim using a realistic e-cigarette setup. Additionally, this study also investigates if such a conversion may occur during smoking of CBD-rich cannabis joints.\nMethods: Two different CBD liquids were vaporized using two different e-cigarette models, one of which was operated at extreme energy settings (0.2 \u03a9 and 200 W). The smoke of six CBD joints was collected using a rotary smoking machine according to ISO 4387:2019. Analyses were conducted using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry as well as liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).\nResults: For the condensed e-cigarette liquids, no increase in THC concentration could be observed. For the CBD joints, no THC formation was provable. The recovered THC concentrations were ranging between 1% and 48% (0.034 mg and 0.73 mg) of the THC amount initially contained in the joints before smoking.\nConclusions: Using realistic conditions of consumer exposure, relevant conversion of CBD to THC appears to not be occurring. The health risk of CBD liquids for electronic cigarettes, as well as low-THC cannabis intended for smoking, can be assessed by concentrations in the source material without the need to consider significant changes in psychotropic compounds during use by consumers.\n", "date": "2022-08-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry; Spectroscopy (Anal.

This work presents a data-driven alternative to rule-based approaches by using a graph siamese neural network architecture. A novel dataset, RBFE-Space, is presented as a representative and transferable training domain for RBFE machine learning research. The workflow presented in this work matches state-of-the-art programmatic RBFE network generation performance with several key benefits. The workflow provides full transferability of the network generator because RBFE-Space is open-sourced and ready to be applied to other RBFE software. Additionally, the deep learning model represents the first machine-learned predictor of perturbation reliability in RBFE calculations.", "date": "2022-08-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We investigated these contacts in detail by using state-of-the-art quantum chemical methods (QM) to characterize some of their physico-chemical properties and to evaluate the ability of the AMBER force field (AFF) to describe these contacts. We found that AFF interaction energies of phosphate\u2026\u03c0 contacts calculated for model dimethyl phosphate\u2026nucleobase systems are less stabilizing in comparison with double-hybrid DFT methods and that the minimum contact distances are stretched for all nucleobase systems. This distance stretch is also observed in large-scale AFF computations on several r(gcGNRAgc) tetraloop hairpins when compared to QM/MM. Further, classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of these tetraloop hairpins confirm this distance stretch and reveal shifted OP2/nucleobase positions when compared to experimental data extracted from high-resolution X ray/cryo EM structures (\u2264 2.5 \u00c5) of r(GNRA) tetraloops using the WebFR3D bioinformatic tool. We propose that discrepancies between QM and AFF are caused by a combination of missing polarization, too large AFF Lennard-Jones (LJ) radii of nucleobase carbon atoms and exaggerated short-range repulsion due to an approximate r\u221212 LJ repulsive term.

The inclusion of this reality in mean field microkinetic models has been largely avoided in favor of lattice-based models like cluster expansions where in principle different types of sites can be explicitly defined. Here, we develop a thermodynamically self-consistent theory of multi-site microkinetics from first principles-based statistical mechanics to show how multiple site types can be represented in mean field microkinetic models. The theory incorporates local enthalpies and entropies, lateral molecular interactions, and macroscopic configurational entropy; generating thermodynamic activities for any number of site types that deviate significant from those of idealized models. We provide the resultant rate expressions for rates of adsorption/desorption and surface diffusion between the site types. Contrary to what is typically assumed, even when a species has access to many different sites or binding configurations, only one rate, which is driven by the average adlayer chemical potential, can be defined for desorption from the surface.

However, there is a lack of understanding of lithium plating/stripping mechanisms at bare solid-state electrolyte (SSE) interfaces since excess lithium is often used. Here, we demonstrate that commercially relevant quantities of lithium (> 5 mAh cm-2) can be reliably plated at relatively high current densities (1 mA cm-2) using the sulfide SSE Li6PS5Cl. Investigations of lithium plating/stripping mechanisms, in conjunction with cryo-focused ion beam (FIB) and ex situ synchrotron tomography, reveal that the cycling stability of these cells is intrinsically limited by spatially uneven plating/stripping. Local lithium depletion toward the end of stripping decreases electrochemically active area, which results in high local current densities and void formation, accelerating subsequent filament growth and short circuiting compared to lithium-excess cells. Despite this governing degradation mode, we show that anode-free cells exhibit comparable Coulombic efficiencies to lithium-excess cells before short circuiting, and improved resistance to short-circuiting is achieved by avoiding local lithium depletion through retention of lithium at the interface.

We find that the experimentally-measured ISC rates of 7-PhQAD originate predominantly from the vibronic coupling, consistent with the previous reports on other MR-type TADF emitters. The SVC effect on ISC rates is about ten times larger than HTVC effect, and the latter increases the ISC rates by more than one order of magnitude while it slightly affects the vibrationally resolved absorption and fluorescence spectra. The discrepancy between the theoretical and ex\u0002perimental results is attributed to the inaccurate description of excited states calculated by the time-dependent density functional theory as well as not fully accounting for the complex experimental conditions.

Charge-neutral iron(II) complexes are a class of SCO complexes that are reported to undergo sublimation, and their spin-state switching characteristics in the thin film state have been studied.

Water rearrangement upon a ligand binding or modification can be very slow and beyond typical timescales used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Thus, inadequate sampling of slow water motions in MD simulations often impairs the accuracy of the accuracy of ligand binding free energy calculations. Previous studies suggest grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) outperforms normal MD simulations for water sampling, thus GCMC has been applied to help improve the accuracy of ligand binding free energy calculations. However, in prior work we observed protein and/or ligand motions impaired how well GCMC performs at water rehydration, suggesting more work is needed to improve this method to handle water sampling. In this work, we applied GCMC in 21 protein-ligand systems to assess the performance of GCMC for rehydrating buried water sites. While our results show that GCMC can rapidly rehydrate all selected water sites for most systems, it fails in 5 systems. In most failed systems, we observe protein/ligand motions, which occur in the absence of water, combine to close water sites and block instantaneous GCMC water insertion moves. For these 5 failed systems, we both extended our GCMC simulations and tested a new technique named grand canonical nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (GCNCMC). GCNCMC combines GCMC with the nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) sampling technique to improve the probability of a successful water insertion/deletion. Our results show that GCNCMC and extended GCMC can rehydrate all target water sites for three of the five problematic systems and GCNCMC is more efficient than GCMC in two out of the three systems. In one system, only GCNCMC can rehydrate all target water sites, while GCMC fails. Both GCNCMC and GCMC fail in one system. This work suggests this new GCNCMC method is promising for water rehydration especially when protein/ligand motions may block water insertion/removal.

Here, we quantify and compare three environmental impacts from inter-regional freight transportation in the contiguous United States: mortality attributable to PM2.5 air pollution, racial-ethnic disparities in mortality from PM2.5, and CO2 emissions. We compare all major transportation modes (truck, rail, barge, aircraft) and all major inter-regional routes (~30,000 routes). Our study is the first to comprehensively compare each route separately, and the first to explore racial-ethnic exposure disparities by route and mode, nationally. Impacts (health, health-disparity, climate) per tonne of freight are largest for aircraft. Among non-aircraft modes, per tonne, rail has the largest health and health-disparity impacts and the lowest climate impacts, whereas truck transport has the lowest health impacts and greatest climate impacts \u2013 an important reminder that health and climate impacts are often but not always aligned. For aircraft and truck, average monetized damages per tonne are larger for climate impacts than for PM2.5 air pollution; for rail and barge, the reverse holds. We find that average exposures for inter-regional truck and rail are the highest for White non-Hispanic people, from barge is highest for Black people, and from aircraft is highest for people who are mixed/other race. Level of exposure and disparity among racial-ethnic groups vary in urban and rural areas. This research can be used to inform, for a given inter-regional origin and destination, which freight mode offers the lowest environmental health, health-disparity, and climate impacts.", "date": "2022-08-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Atmospheric Chemistry; Environmental Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Originally, chemists believed that a drug molecule consists of a scaffold with several substituents. While the substituents were replaced by alternate functional groups (aka substructures), the activity value of the molecule would be changed accordingly. This is termed as structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR), which can be used to guide chemists to chemically modify the molecule to improve its druggability. Along with the progress of computing technology, SAR evolved into QSAR (Quantitative SAR). QSAR method prevailed in the era when determinism dominated the scientific community. Therefore, the paradigm of QSAR studies was based on the thought of \u201cdiscovering the analytical rules (analytical formula of functional) between independent variables and functions hidden in experimental data by curve fitting or regression\u201d. Earlier QSAR was based upon so called the similarity and additivity postulates. With the advent of the era of high-throughput experiments and big data, the two postulates are facing serious challenges. Coupled with the puzzling problems (such as substructure partitioning, \u201cactivity cliff\u201d, unbalanced data sampling, and the paradox of prediction accuracy and generalization), conventional QSAR was declining from mature. In the beginning of this century, artificial intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning (DL), significantly succussed in image pattern recognition and natural language processing (NPL). AI was soon adopted for QSAR studies as a disruptive approach. It is now believed that drug design can be data-driven instead of rule-based (curve-fitting or regression). QSAR can also be directly revealed by AI without knowing the mechanisms of actions. Thus, the two postulates of conventional QSAR are no longer required, and the associated puzzling problems or paradoxes could be resolved. By examining the historical pathway of QSAR evolving into AI assisted drug design (AIDD), this review summarizes the process how the drug design paradigm is transformed from determinism to causalitism + probabilitism. The principles and challenges of drug design methodology are explored, the pros and cons for QSAR and AIDD are discussed with perspectives. It is worth noting that although AIDD is powerful, it is not omnipotent and should be treated rationally. The essence of machine learning is to reveal the major trends of a data set; while the minor trends (aka outliers, which are often ignored or discarded) cannot be captured by AI algorithms. However, the outliers are likely to be the entrances to disruptive discoveries. Therefore, philosophically, it is unrealistic to develop innovative drugs only relying on AIDD. AIDD\u2019s achievements rely on inheriting the legacy of QSAR's theories, methods, technologies, and data.", "date": "2022-08-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The objective of the filter is to convert interferents into species that interact weakly with the recognition element of the sensor. \n\nMathematical models may be useful for optimizing the design parameters of the catalytic filter. Particularly, if the catalyst is not perfectly selective for the interferent over the analyte, we hypothesize the existence of an optimal residence time of the gas in the filter. Short residence times allow too much interferent to reach the sensor and corrupt its response, while long residence times degrade too much of the analyte, diminishing the signal-to-noise ratio.\n    \nHerein, we develop a toy mathematical and probabilistic model of a catalytic filter and gas sensor in series. We model (a) the catalytic filter as an isothermal, packed-bed reactor that decomposes the interferent and analyte with first-order kinetics and reactant-selectivity for the interferent and (b) the cross-sensitive gas sensor as gravimetric, producing a response with contributions from the analyte and interferent, governed by the competitive Langmuir adsorption model. Under distributions of (a) concentrations of interferent and analyte in the sensing environment and (b) measurement noise corrupting the response of the sensor, we simulate deployment of the model catalytic filter-gas sensor, where the objective is to accurately predict the concentration of the analyte in the gas phase from the response of the sensor. The performance of the catalytic filter-gas sensor is measured by the expected error in the predicted concentration of the analyte.

However, close contact between \u03c0-systems leads to strong electronic coupling and often subse-quent quenching of the emitters in dense solid-state materials. Recently, we developed a method to prohibit strong coupling based on small molecule ionic isolation lattices (SMILES) that efficiently isolate fluorophores while in paral-lel ensuring very high densities of the dyes. Nevertheless, efficient FRET energy migration in such dense systems is inevitable. While attractive for energy harvesting applications, FRET also significantly compromises quantum yields of fluorescent solids by funneling excitation energy to dark trap states like crystal defects. Here we investigate the underlying property of FRET and exploit it to our favor by intentionally introducing fluorescent dopants into SMILES materials, acting as FRET acceptors with favorable photophysical properties. This doping is shown to outcompete en-ergy migration to dark trap states, while also ruling out reabsorption effects in dense SMILES materials, resulting in universal fluorescent solid state materials (thin films, powders, crystals) with superior properties. These include emission quantum yields reaching as high as 50-65 %, programmable fluorescence lifetimes with mono-exponential decay, and independent selection of absorption and emission maxima.

An attractive thermochemical route for the introduction of large-scale production of biofuels in the transport sector in the near future is to convert the biomass to a liquid (pyrolysis oil) via fast pyrolysis followed by co-processing with fossil oil in existing refinery infrastructures. In this study, Salix was first liquefied using ablative fast pyrolysis in a pilot scale unit. The resulting pyrolysis oil, rich in oxygenates, was co-refined in 20 wt.% ratio with fossil feedstocks using two different technologies, a fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) laboratory unit, and a continuous slurry hydroprocessing pilot plant. \nIn the FCC route, the pyrolysis oil was cracked at 525 \u00b0C using a commercial FCC catalyst at atmospheric pressures and resulted in significant deoxygenation (97 wt.%). To determine the biogenic carbon in the co-refined liquid product, C14 analysis was conducted. The whole conversion route resulted in 11 wt.% of the biogenic carbon from Salix ended up in liquid products, the rest being gaseous products, bio-char from the pyrolysis, and coke (16 wt.%) from the FCC upgrading. The hydroprocessing was conducted at 420 \u00b0C, at a hydrogen pressure of 150 bars at a liquid hourly space velocity of 0.67 h-1, in the presence of an unsupported molybdenum sulfide catalyst. The hydroprocessing resulted also in significant deoxygenation of the liquid product (93 wt.%). The whole conversion route resulted in 26 wt.% of the biogenic carbon from Salix ending up as liquid hydrocarbons, the rest was mainly gaseous hydrocarbons, carbon oxides, and bio-char. \nThe study showed that it is feasible to co-refine pyrolysis oil using both methods, the main difference being that hydroprocessing results in a significantly higher yield of hydrocarbon products but also would require an input of H2 while in the cracking route a significant part ends up as gas and as coke on the catalyst. The choice of routes is foremost dependent on the available amount of bio-oil and refining infrastructures. Besides liquid biofuel, it is also vital to utilize the biogenic carbon material in the bio-char and in the gaseous products. \n", "date": "2022-08-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Petrochemicals; Fuels - Energy Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In the present study, we have highlighted the behavior of the three most widely used water models\u2014TIP3P, SPC/E, and OPC for three different CYP450 enzymes\u2014CYP450BM3, CYP450OleT, and CYP450BS\u03b2 during MD simulations and QM/MM calculations. We studied the various properties such as RMSD, RMSF, H-bond, water occupancy in the first solvation shell, and Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) using QM/MM calculations and compared them for all the three water models. Our study shows that the stability of the enzyme structure is well maintained in all three water models. However, OPC water model performs well for the polar active sites, i.e., in CYP450OleT, CYP450BS\u03b2 while the TIP3P water model is superior for the hydrophobic site such as CYP450BM3.", "date": "2022-08-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Kinetics and Mechanism - Inorganic Reactions; Theory - Computational; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The solar cell service lifetime as quantified by the T80 (the time required for the power conversion efficiency to drop to 80% of its starting value) is a useful metric to assess stability. The T80 for utility, commercial, or residential PV systems needs to be several decades in order to yield low-cost electricity, and thus it is not practical to directly measure the T80. It would be useful if T80 could be predicted from the initial dynamics of a solar cell\u2019s performance, but until now no models have been developed to forecast T80. In this work, we report the development of machine learning models to predict T80 of ITO/NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3/C60/BCP/Ag solar cells operating at maximum power point under 1-sun equivalent photon flux in air at varying temperatures and relative humidities. Efficiency losses are driven by short-circuit current and fill factor, indicating that chemical decomposition of the perovskite is a major contributor to degradation. Spatial patterns evident from in situ dark field optical microscopy suggest that the electric field gradient at device edges plays a significant role in perovskite decomposition, along with photochemical reactions with O2 and H2O. Models are trained using a menu of features from three distinct categories: (i) features based on measurements of the initial rates of change of device parameters, (ii) features based on the ambient conditions during operation (temperature, & partial pressure of H2O), and (iii) features based on underlying physics and chemistry. We show that a theory-based physiochemical feature derived from a model of the chemical reaction kinetics of the rate of degradation of the CH3NH3PbI3 is particularly valuable for prediction. This physiochemical feature was selected as the first or second most dominant feature in the best performing models. With a dataset consisting of 45 accelerated degradation experiments with T80 that range over a factor of 30, the model predicts T80 with an accuracy of about 40% (|predicted T80 - observed T80| / observed T80) on samples not used in training.

Hence, understanding their absorption and emission spectra gives clues about packing and coherence properties, essential for energy transport. We attempt to calculate the steady-state spectra of linear aggregates. We approached this problem by following the vibronic excitonic framework discussed by Spano and co-workers [Hestand & Spano, Chem. Rev. 2018, 118, 7069-7163]. The framework allows us to incorporate the influence of nuclear relaxation energy through the one-particle and two-particle states. We also study the effects of local static disorder, finite temperature, and periodic boundary conditions. We implement the calculation of the photoluminescence and absorption spectra in the user-friendly language MATLAB in a manner that allows sequentially increasing the complexity of the model by considering more effects as needed. The calculated spectra have been validated by matching them with spectra produced by Spano et al. Hence, we have implemented a robust code that can model spectra from linear aggregates of any size and orientation, subject to computational limitations. We are currently using these codes to assign the steady state spectra and speculate the morphology of several types of thin films made of donor-acceptor dyes obtained by an experimental collaborator at SSCU; these dyes are being put forward for use for increasing the efficiency of photovoltaic cells through the multi-exciton generation mechanism of singlet fission.

Through comparative study with CF/epoxy, the disparate drilling performance of the two composites has been uncovered, and the results were found to be closely related to the materials\u2019 thermal/mechanical properties.

On the A-terminated and B-terminated surfaces, which differ in the relative number of Co2+ and Co3+ ions at the surface, 2-propanol adsorbs molecularly on the Co2+ and Co3+ sites, respectively. In both cases, no C-H bond cleavage is observed at room temperature. However, under oxidative conditions, which are modeled here by partial dehydrogenation of the mixed hydroxyl/water adsorbate layer, dehydrogenation of the alcoholic OH group is observed on both surface terminations. As a result, adsorbed 2-propanolate is formed. The reaction on the less hydroxylated B- terminated surface further proceeds with C-H bond cleavage at the 2-carbon atom. The oxidation product acetone remains adsorbed on the Co3+ site during the simulation period of approximately 20 ps. Both deprotonation steps are aided by the presence of the adsorbed hydroxyl groups in the vicinity of the adsorbed alcohol molecule, because both hydrogen atoms from the reac- tand molecule are transferred as protons to form adsorbed water molecules. Different from the case of the partially dehydrogenated environment, raising the system temperature from 300 to 450 K, which can be considered a simple model for high temperature thermal catalysis, does not lead to oxidation via C-H dehydrogenation of the 2-propanol molecule.\n", "date": "2022-08-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Typically, these complexes feature an auxiliary 2,2-bipyridine ligand which assists in redox steps by delocalizing electron density into the ligand-orbitals. While this feature lends to accessible redox potential for CO2 electroreduction, it also presents challenges for electrocatalysis with manganese, since the electron density is removed from metal-ligand bonding orbitals. The results presented here thus introduce mesoionic carbene (MIC) as a new potent ligand platform to promote Mn-based electrocatalysis. The strong \u03c3-donation of the N,C-bidentate MIC is shown to help centralize electron density on the Mn-center while also maintaining relevant redox potentials for CO2 electroreduction. Mechanistic investigation supports catalytic turnover at two operative potentials separated by 400 mV.

Chapagain; Ralph Jimenez", "abstract": "We recently developed the red fluorescent protein (RFP) mCherry-XL, which is threefold brighter than its predecessor, mCherry, with a directed evolution approach using fluorescence-lifetime flow cytometry selections. The enhanced brightness is due to a significant decrease in the non-radiative decay rate underlying its increase in fluorescence quantum yield. To examine the dynamic role of the four mutations that distinguish the two RFPs and closely-related variants, we employed microsecond-timescale, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to sample their ground state conformational landscapes. The simulations revealed the significance of the I197R mutation, which leads to the formation of multiple hydrogen-bonded contacts. The triad of interactions observed between residues K70, E148 and 197R is also seen in mScarlet, another RFP of unrelated origin, but of comparably high brightness. These substitutions in mCherry-XL increased the rigidity of the \u03b2-barrel, for example as shown by increased hydrogen-bonding in the chromophore region and decreased root-mean-square backbone deviations. Furthermore, mCherry-XL showed significantly less ns-timescale breathing of the gap between \u03b2-7 and \u03b2-10 strands. This gap was previously shown to be the most flexible region of mCherry, permitting entry of O2 into the barrel. We also characterize the role played by the sidechain of residue 161 using a combination of MD simulations and in-vitro experimental characterization. We find this position is critical to the steric interactions that perturb the chromophore electronic structure.  MD simulations also help us to recognize a network of hydrogen-bonded interactions between the chromophore, the residue 143, 163 and 59, which can potentially impact the electron distribution of the chromophore. Finally, we shed light on the conformational dynamics of the conserved residues R95 and S146, which are hydrogen bonded to the chromophore, and provide physical insights into the observed photophysics.

Structural understanding of the terminal repeats is well-established for many repeat proteins with the common \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet foldings. By contrast, the sequence-structure interplay of the terminal repeats of the collagen triple-helix remains unexplored to date. As the most abundant human repeat protein and the most prevalent structural component of the extracellular matrix, collagen features a hallmark triple-helix formed by three supercoiled polypeptide chains of long repeating sequences of the Gly-X-Y triplets. Here, with CD characterization of 28 collagen-mimetic peptides (CMPs) featuring various terminal motifs, as well as DSC measurements, crystal structure analysis, and computational simulations, we show that CMPs only differing in terminal repeat may have distinct end structures and stabilities. We reveal that the cross-chain hydrogen bonding mediated by the terminal repeat is key to maintaining the triple-helix\u2019s end structure, and that disruption of it with a single amide to carboxylate substitution can lead to destabilization as drastic as 19 \u00b0C. We further demonstrate that the terminal repeat also impacts how strong the CMP strands form hybrid triple-helices with unfolded natural collagen chains in tissue. Our findings provide a fresh spatial profile of hydrogen bonding within the CMP triple-helix, marking a critical guideline for future crystallographic or NMR studies of collagen, and algorithms for predicting triple-helix stability, as well as peptide-based collagen assemblies and materials.

Via water transport experiments, we show that the slip length of the nanochannels decay exponentially with the hydrated diameter of the intercalated cations, confirming that water transport is governed by the interaction between water molecules and the impurities on the channel wall. The exponential decay of slip length approximates non-slip conditions. This offers experimental support for the use of the Hagen-Poiseuille equation in graphene-based nanochannels, which was previously only confirmed by simulations. Our study gives valuable feedback to theoretical predictions of the water transport along graphene-based channels with water-attracting impurities.", "date": "2022-08-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Carbon-based Materials; Nanofluidics; Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Photocatalytic action depends on efficient separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs, and recently, it was discovered that this separation can be improved by incorporation of donor-acceptor motifs into the polymer backbones. While there are many examples of electron donors, there is little variety in electron acceptor motifs.

The probe is highly specific for mycobacteria and could image mycobacteria in the presence of other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Both the photoactivation and detection can be achieved using a handheld UV lamp, and bacteria of 103 CFU/mL or higher can be seen by the naked eye.

Studies using heat-killed, stationary phase and isoniazid-treated mycobacteria showed that metabolically active bacteria are required for the uptake of Tre-Cz. The uptake decreased in the presence of trehalose in a concentration dependent manner, indicating that Tre-Cz hijacks the trehalose uptake pathway.

Here we utilize transmission electron microscopy (TEM), systematic synthesis, and mass spectrometry (MS) to demonstrate that HEA nanoparticles form by aggregation of non-crystalline multimetallic cluster intermediates. AuAgCuPtPd HEA nanoparticles were synthesized by aqueous co-reduction of metal salts with sodium borohydride in the presence of thiolated polymer ligands. Varying the metal:ligand ratio during synthesis showed that alloyed HEA nanoparticles formed only above a threshold ligand concentration. Alloyed sub-nanometer clusters were observed with the final HEA nanoparticles while few clusters were observed when phase-separated nanoparticles formed. Increasing supersaturation ratio increased particle size, which together with the observations of stable single atoms smaller than the critical nuclei size was inconsistent with a burst nucleation mechanism. Direct real-time observations with liquid phase TEM imaging showed that HEA nanoparticles formed by aggregation of sub-nanometer clusters. Taken together, these results are consistent with a reaction mechanism involving rapid reduction of metal ions into sub-nanometer alloyed clusters, followed by cluster aggregation driven by borohydride ion induced thiol ligand desorption.

Herein, a facile [2+2] cycloaddition-cycloreversion ([2+2] CA-CR) reaction is employed for the efficient synthesis of nonplanar molecule (2ATPE-2F4) containing triphenylamine (TPA) and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) under ambient conditions by taking advantage of its click feature, atom-economic, unity yield, and simple purified procedure, etc. The resultant product exhibits exceptional properties including broad absorption edge over 1000 nm, and substantial radical characters with paramagnetic behavior, etc. Excitingly, it exhibits excellent photothermal properties and the temperature could be swiftly increased to as high as 450 \u00b0C in solid powder upon photo-irradiation. Thanks to the excellent photothermal properties, 2ATPE-2F4 was used for the construction of high temperature (> 200 oC) shape memory actuators triggered with NIR light. In addition, upon assembling the 2ATPE-2F4 into nanoparticle (2ATPE-2F4 NPs), it displayed good biocompatibility, excellent photothermal stability, and high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), enable it to be used to realize high-efficiency photothermal therapy.

In this work, we identified a class of commercialized antibiotics, such as levofloxacin, norfloxacin, and moxifloxacin (MXF) hydrochloride, featuring the unique aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics. By taking advantage of their AIE feature, antibiotic metabolism in cells could be in situ visualized, which clearly shows that the luminescent aggregates accumulate in the lysosomes.

The compounds have been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallographic analysis and inspection of the bond metrics within the \u03b76-coordinated aryl substituent of the bridging imidazolin-2-iminato ligand show perturbation of the aromatic system most consistent with two-electron reduction of the ring. As such, 2 and 3 can be assigned respectively as possessing metal centers in formal Ti(III)/Ti(III) and Ti(II)/Ti(II) oxidation states.  Exploration of their redox chemistry reveal the ability to reduce several substrate equivalents. For instance, treatment of 2 with excess C8H8 (COT) forms the novel COT-bridged complex [(ImDippN)(\u03b78-COT)Ti](\u03bc-\u03b72:\u03b73-COT)[Ti(\u03b74-COT)(NImDipp)] (4) that dissociates in THF solutions to give mononuclear (ImDippN)Ti(\u03b78-COT)(THF) (5).

Herein, we investigated the redox cycle of nickel (II) bis(diethyldithiocarbamate), NiII(dtc)2, for potential use as a multi-electron storage catholyte in non-aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs). Previous studies have shown the unique redox cycle of NiII(dtc)2 offers 2e- chemistry upon oxidation from NiII \u2192 NiIV but 1e- chemistry upon reduction from NiIV \u2192 NiIII \u2192 NiII. Electrochemical experiments presented here show that the addition of as little as 10 mol% ZnII(ClO4)2 to the electrolyte consolidates the two 1e- reduction peaks into a single 2e- reduction where [NiIV(dtc)3]+ is reduced directly to NiII(dtc)2. This catalytic enhancement is believed to be due to ZnII removal of a dtc- ligand from a NiIII(dtc)3 intermediate, resulting in more facile reduction to NiII(dtc)2. The addition of ZnII also improves the 2e- oxidation, shifting the anodic peak negative and decreasing the 2e- peak splitting. H-cell cycling experiments showed that 97% coulombic efficiency and 98% charge storage efficiency was maintained for 50 cycles over 25 h using 0.1 M ZnII(ClO4)2 as supporting electrolyte. If ZnII(ClO4)2 was replaced with TBAPF6  in the electrolyte, the coulombic efficiency fell to 78%.

A key strategy to address this challenge is to introduce a secondary solvent as a diluent that reduces the salt content while maintaining the local structure of salt-concentrated electrolytes, giving rise to localized high concentration electrolytes (LHCEs). Through a thorough investigation involving ~700 samples, we find that, the dielectric constant of solvent, a widely used parameter for electrolyte design, does not serve as a useful screening criterion for diluents; instead, donor number (DN) is an effective design parameter to achieve LHCE structure, i.e., the primary solvent must have DN > 10 and the diluent must have DN < 10. Correlating DN with solvent solubility leads to a simpler screening rule: Li-salt-insoluble solvents are diluents while Li-salt-soluble solvents become co-solvents. Both DN- and solubility-based design principles can be understood in an atomistic model of LHCE and are applicable to other electrolyte systems.", "date": "2022-08-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Energy; Energy Storage; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Solution Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, current COF synthetic routes lead to insoluble aggregates which hamper processing and prohibit their use in many applications. Here, we report a novel COF synthesis method that produces a stable, homogeneous suspension of crystalline COF nanoparticles. Our approach involves the use of a polar solvent, di-acid catalyst, and slow reagent mixing procedure at elevated temperatures which all together enable access to crystalline COF nanoparticle suspension that does not aggregate or precipitate when kept at elevated temperatures. On cooling, the suspension undergoes a thermoreversible gelation transition to produce crystalline and highly porous COF materials. We demonstrate that this method enables the preparation of COF monoliths, membranes, and films using conventional solution processing techniques. We show that the modified synthesis approach is compatible with various COF chemistries, including both large- and small-pore imine COFs, hydrazone-linked COFs, and COFs with rhombic and hexagonal topology, and in each case, we demonstrate that the final product has excellent crystallinity and porosity. The final materials contain both micro- and macropores, and the total porosity can be tuned through variation of sample annealing. Dynamic light scattering measurements reveal the presence of COF nanoparticles that grow with time at room temperature, transitioning from a homogeneous suspension to a gel. Finally, we prepare imine COF membranes and measure their rejection of polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers and oligomers, and these measurements exhibit size-dependent rejection of PEG solutes.

In this work, we present a new method to detect signals from microorganisms at buried interfaces that is non-destructive and can be conducted continuously. Inspired by vascular systems in nature that permit chemical communication between the surface and underlying tissues of an organism, we created a system in which an inert carrier fluid could be introduced into an empty vascular network embedded in a polymer matrix. When a microorganism layer was grown on top, small molecules produced by the growth process would diffuse down into the carrier fluid, which could then be collected and analyzed. We used this system to non-destructively detect signals from a surface layer of Escherichia coli using conductivity, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for organic acids; methods that ranged in sensitivity, time-to-result, and cost. Carrier fluid from sample vascularized polymers with surface bacterial growth recorded significantly higher values in both conductivity and absorbance at 350 nm compared to controls with no bacteria after 24 h. HPLC analysis showed three clear peaks that varied between the samples with bacteria and the controls without. Test tracking the change in signals over 48 h showed clear trends that matched the growth curve and demonstrated the system\u2019s ability to monitor changes over time. A theoretical model of the system closely matched the experimental results, confirming the predictability of the system. Finally, tests using clinically relevant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa yielded differences in conductivity, absorbance, and HPLC peak areas unique to each species.

Here, we present composite air filters featuring a bio-inspired liquid coating that facilitates the removal of captured aerosolized bacteria and viruses for further analysis. We tested three types of air filters: commercial polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is well-known for creating stable liquid coatings, commercial high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which are widely used, and in-house manufactured cellulose nanofiber mats (CNFM), which are made from sustainable materials. All filters were coated with omniphobic fluorinated liquid to maximize release. We found that coating both the PTFE and HEPA filters with liquid improved the rate at which Escherichia coli was recovered using a physical removal process compared to uncoated controls. Notably, the coated HEPA filters also increased the total number of recovered cells by 57%. Coating the CNFM filters did not improve either the rate of release or total number of captured cells. The ability of the highest performance materials, the liquid-coated HEPA filters were next evaluated on their ability to facilitate the removal of pathogenic viruses via a chemical removal process. Recovery of infectious JC polyomavirus, a non-enveloped virus which attacks the central nervous system, was increased by 92% over uncoated controls; however, there was no significant difference in the total amount of RNA recovered compared to controls. In contrast, significantly more RNA was recovered for SARS-CoV-2, the airborne, enveloped virus which causes COVID-19, from liquid-coated filters. Although the amount of infectious SARS-CoV-2 recovered was 58% higher, these results were not significantly different from uncoated filters due to high variability.

Our study shows that the His88 close to the catalytic site acts as a modulator of aromaticity and is essential to initiate the C-H and C-F bond activation. The reaction proceeds via the proton abstraction from the 4-OH group of the substrate by His88, which is coupled with an electron transfer to form a single-electron reduced Cpd I-like intermediate. This species then inserts the oxygen atom into the sp3 hybridized C-H and C-F bond of the substrate.

However, supported molecular catalysts (i.e., hybrid electrodes) are multiplexed and not fully understood with regards to specific support-catalyst interactions. Even so, it still remains that catalyst activity for CO2 electroreduction can be tuned by modifying specific functional groups to achieve performance enhancement. Herein, a series of derivatized [Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl] catalysts were prepared with molecular structures having variability in both the number of Re-centers and \u03c0-conjugated diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units. While tethering [Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl] to the DPP unit had a negligible effect on molecular electro- and photo- catalyst properties in organic solvent, the DPP chromophore enabled facile coupling of two [Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl] moieties. As a homogenous species, the bimetallic system effectively doubles the rate of CO2-to-CO conversion in the reaction-diffusion layer achieving a TOFCO = 1000 s-1 and FEco% = 98 % for up to 6 hours of electrolysis as the two catalytic centers act independently. Immobilization onto carbon hybrid electrodes was found to evolve H2, where the ratio of CO:H2 produced during electrolysis depended on both the molecular structure of the catalyst and the additive(s) to the carbon surface used to suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Introducing a commercial DPP-based polymer and/or colloid imprinted carbons (CICs) into carbon paper favours CO evolution from the catalyst by suppressing the HER at carbon and by dispersing the molecular catalyst across a larger more wettable surface to mitigate mass transport limitations. Once again, the bimetallic catalyst has the highest activity in comparison to the monometallic analogues, with a selectivity (FEco%  = 53%), activity (TOF = 39 hr-1), and longevity (active for up to 5 hours) for CO2-to-CO evolution from aqueous electrolyte.

Narrow-gap semiconductors and semimetals have garnered interest for Peltier cooling, especially following the discovery of Mg3Bi2-based materials. New TE materials with high coefficients of performance are needed to further advance this technology. Computations have enabled the discovery and design of new TE materials. Large-scale computational searches often rely on material descriptors, which are based on the single-band model that does not account for bipolar conduction effects. In this work, we derive three material descriptors to assess the TE performance of narrow-gap semiconductors and semimetals -- band gap, n- and p-type TE quality factors, and an asymmetry parameter. These computationally-accessible descriptors are derived from Boltzmann transport theory applied to a two-band model. We show that a large asymmetry parameter is critical to achieving high TE performance through suppression of bipolar conduction. We validate the predictive power of the descriptors by correctly identifying Mg3Bi2 as a high-performing room-temperature TE material. By applying these descriptors to a broader set of 650 Zintl phases, we identify four candidate materials for room-temperature TEs, namely, SrSb2, Zn3As2, NaZnSb, and NaCdSb. The proposed material descriptors will enable fast targeted search of narrow-gap semiconductors and semimetals for low-temperature TEs.

Based on partition studies for nonionic surfactants, the HLD can be interpreted as a normalized chemical potential difference between the surfactant dissolved in water and oil. The Net-Average Curvature (NAC) model extrapolates this interpretation into a curvature form that has been used to fit and predict the phase behavior of surfactant-oil-water (SOW) systems. The curvature interpretation of HLD led to the renaming of the HLD surfactant parameter, sigma (\u03c3), as the characteristic curvature (Cc). This work addresses two concerns around this interpretation; first, for ionic surfactants, an HLD\u22600 value for one surfactant might not mean the same for another (breaking the chemical potential interpretation), and second, the Cc interpretation has not been demonstrated. To this end, the net curvature (Hn) of six anionic and two cationic surfactants was evaluated (individually) from solubilization data at the characteristic condition of 25\u00b0C, no added cosolvent, in the presence of an oil mixture with equivalent alkane carbon number (EACN) of zero, and as a function of salinity.

Given the high cost in both resources and time for experimental efforts, computational approaches play a key role in guiding the selection of promising molecules for further investigation. Here, we construct a workflow to accelerate design by combining approximate quantum chemical methods [i.e. density-functional tight-binding (DFTB)], a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) surrogate model for chemical property prediction, and a masked language model (MLM) for molecule generation. Property data from the DFTB calculations are used to train the surrogate model; the surrogate model is used to score candidates generated by the MLM. The surrogate reduces computation time by orders of magnitude compared to the DFTB calculations, enabling an increased search of chemical space. Furthermore, the MLM generates a diverse set of chemical modifications based on pre-training from a large compound library. We utilize the workflow to search for near-infrared photoactive molecules by minimizing the predicted HOMO-LUMO gap as the target property. Our results show that the workflow can generate optimized molecules outside of the original training set, which suggests that iterations of the workflow could be useful for searching vast chemical spaces in a wide range of design problems.

The \u03b1-lactams are also members of this group of compounds, but, until this point, their utility within the field has been unexplored. Here, we demonstrate an \u03b1-lactam reagent that can be efficiently employed in the framework of bioconjugation and proteomic profiling. We have designed and synthesised a stable \u03b1-lactam, AM2, that is compatible with aqueous buffers, and have extensively characterised its properties and reactivity. In simple settings, AM2 was e.g. found to be reactive towards both thiols and amines, with the former reacting significantly faster. We further demonstrated that AM2 undergoes conjugation to free cysteine residues in peptides suggesting applications for bioconjugation. Interestingly, liver carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), a serine hydrolase with key roles in both endo- and xenobiotic metabolism, was found as a highly selective covalent target for AM2 in HepG2 liver cancer cells.

In this work, we discovered that an anatase TiO2 synthesized by a sol-gel method (TiO2-A-SG) exhibits drastically better activity and selectivity as the support for low-loading Ru than other oxides in polypropylene (PP) upcycling under H2. Detailed analysis and control experiments with Ni and Pt revealed that this is because Ru/TiO2-A-SG also catalyzes hydrocracking besides hydrogenolysis. In addition to favoring high-valued liquid products, this  increases branched alkane fraction from low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and allows efficient PP upcycling without noble metals. The unexpected Br\u00f8nsted acidity of TiO2-A-SG is linked to the carboxylate layers TiO2 surfaces adsorb from air. Kinetic studies revealed that under testing conditions, the two pathways compete for dehydrogenated intermediates on metal surfaces, with low hydrogen pressure (PH2) and high branching level of the substrate favoring hydrocracking. Hydrogenolysis is the main pathway at PH2 = 30 bar for all tested substrates less branched than PP, in which the cleavage of 2C\u22122C bonds is strongly favored over that of 3C\u2212xC bonds. This work reveals and compares the two co-occurring polyolefin upcycling pathways on a metal-acid bifunctional catalyst, offers insights to the complex reaction network, and how it is affected by catalysts and conditions.

Herein, a layered cobalt borophosphate precatalyst, Co(H2O)2[B2P2O8(OH)2]\u2219H2O, is fully reconstructed into two different CoCat phases. In marked contrast to previous reports, this reconstruction is not initiated at the surface but at the electrode substrate to catalyst interface.

Considering and interconnecting these aspects together with proton mass transport limitations, we provide a comprehensive picture explaining the different OER activities. The most decisive factors are the buffers used for reconstruction, the number of edge sites that are not inhibited by irreversibly bond buffers, and the morphology of the catalysts.

Herein, we report the photochemically-mediated polymerization of pyridine and furan aromatic precursors, which achieves nanothread formation at reduced pressures. In the case of pyridine, it was found that a combination of slow compression/decompression with broadband UV light exposure yielded a crystalline product featuring a six-fold diffraction pattern with similar interplanar spacings of previously synthesized pyridine-derived nanothreads at a reduced pressure. When furan is compressed to 8 GPa and exposed to broadband UV light, a crystalline solid is recovered that similarly demonstrates X-ray diffraction with an interplanar spacing akin to that of the high-pressure synthesized furan-derived nanothreads. Our method realizes a 1.9-fold reduction in the maximum pressure required to afford furan-derived nanothreads and a 1.4-fold reduction in pressure required pyridine-derived nanothreads. Density functional theory and multiconfigurational wavefunction-based computations were used to understand the photochemical activation of furan and subsequent cascade thermal cycloadditions.

Photophysical properties of SPANI in aqueous medium were also investigated using steady state spectroscopic techniques, which suggested the co-existence of two conformations (\u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019) of SPANI in the normal working low acidic medium. Also, combined red-edge effect was observed from the two conformations of SPANI in aqueous medium. In the present work, a detailed investigation is carried out on the ultrafast photophysical properties of SPANI in aqueous medium by employing femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy based on pump-probe technique. It is found that excited state absorption from the S1 state of SPANI in aqueous medium to higher electronic states originates mostly due to the conformation \u2018A\u2019 in the whole spectral range and very weakly due to the conformation \u2018B\u2019 on the blue side of the spectra.

Beside unpleasant smells, exposure to airborne contaminants can directly impact our health. However, the comprehensive understanding of the composition and behavior of the indoor volatile and semi-volatile compounds (volatilome) is limited, in part due to the tremendous complexity and fleeting nature of these chemical distributions. This study explored the comprehensive volatilome, as opposed to individual compounds, of the indoor environment of a residence. For the first time, we mapped a spatial distribution of volatiles within a house as well as traced temporal volatilome changes. The impact of occupants\u2019 activities over a month period were assessed in relation to the observed indoor volatile chemistry and changes in global chemical distributions across time. Each indoor activity generated a trail of volatiles, and the indoor volatilome after human habitation was found to be distinctly reshaped. Using molecular networking, we explored how multiple chemical families were affected. The portion of volatilome that has accumulated due to human occupancy appears to be more harmful to human health than emissions from the built environment itself. This is an important consideration for any other human environment with accumulated volatile chemistry, such as hospitals or office spaces. \n", "date": "2022-08-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Environmental Analysis; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This approach provided very limited success, since there are multiple proteins involved in the complex cell signaling disease mechanisms.\n Objective: To elucidate using machine learning (ML) the set of drugs targeting a group of proteins involved in the mechanism of cytokine storm. \nMethods: We selected for targeting five proteins: Angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R), A disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF \ud835\udf05B), Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) that are involved in the SARS CoV 2 induced cytokine storm pathway. We developed ML models for these five proteins, using known active inhibitors. After developing the model for each of these proteins, FDA-approved drugs were screened to find novel therapeutics for COVID 19. \nResults: We identified twenty drugs that are active for four proteins and eight drugs active for five proteins. Mitomycin C is the most active drug across all five proteins with an average prediction score of 0.886. For further validation of these results, we used the PyRx software to conduct protein\u2013ligand docking experiments and calculated the binding affinity.

The number of possible compositions makes it impossible to study all of them. Therefore, sophisticated methods are required to intelligently select interesting compositions. On one hand, adding an element to a composition space increases the dimensionality of that space and the number of compositions within it combinatorially. However, it also increases the number of sub-spaces that are part of this larger composition space. Assuming a constant sampling density, the number of experiments required to study a large, combined composition space of sufficient dimensionality can be less than studying all of its individual sub-spaces. This hypothesis is investigated using experimental work in which 200 compositions in an 8-element composition space composed of Au, Ir, Os, Pd, Pt, Re, Rh, and Ru were synthesized as nanoparticles. Each composition was experimentally tested for the electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction. The model that was constructed using this data turned out to adequately predict data in three of its 5-element composition sub-spaces. This observation paves way for a backward elimination strategy in HEA discovery. According to this strategy all elements of interest are studied in a single composition space from which knowledge of all subspaces can be learnt. Subsequently, elements that do not show a positive influence towards the studied reaction can be removed from the search space.

TIC is the first reported thionolactone to readily homopolymerize under free radical conditions without the presence of a dormant comonomer or repeated initiation. Even more, the resulting polymer is fully degradable under mild, basic conditions. Computations providing molecular-level insights into the mechanistic and energetic details of polymerization identified a unique S,S,O-orthoester intermediate that leads to a sustained chain-end. This sustained chain-end allowed for the synthesis of a block copolymer of TIC and styrene under entirely free radical conditions without explicit radical control methods such as reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT). We also report the statistical copolymerization of ring-retained TIC and styrene, confirmed by elemental analysis and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).  Computations into the energetic details of copolymerization indicate kinetic drivers for ring-retaining behavior. This work provides the first example of a sustainable feedstock for rROP and provides the field with the first six-membered monomer susceptible to rROP, expanding the monomer scope to aid our fundamental understanding of thionolactone rROP behavior.

A well-established fabrication process involves the supramolecular assembly of organic molecules (e.g. block copolymers, and surfactants) with inorganic materials obtained by sol-gel chemistry. Typically, subsequent calcination in air serves to remove the organic template and reveal the pores. A major challenge for such coatings is the anisotropic shrinkage due to the volume contraction related to solvent evaporation, inorganic condensation, and template removal, affecting the final porosity as well as pore shape, size, arrangement and accessibility. Here, we show that a two-step calcination process, composed of high-temperature treatment in argon followed by air calcination, leads to reduced film contraction and enhanced structural control. Crucially, the formation of a transient carbonaceous scaffold enables the inorganic matrix to fully condense before template removal. The resulting mesoporous films retain a higher porosity as well as larger, more uniform pores with extended hexagonally closed-packed order. Such films present favorable characteristics for a variety of applications, such as improved mass transport of large biomolecules. This is demonstrated for the adsorption and desorption of lysozyme into the mesoporous thin films as an example of enzyme storage.", "date": "2022-08-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Coating Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Nanofabrication; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we report a hierarchical nanoporous Cu catalyst doped with small amounts of Ti (npTiCu) that increases the rate of H2-D2 exchange by approximately one order of magnitude compared to the undoped nanoporous Cu (npCu) catalyst. The promotional effect of Ti was measured via steady-state H2-D2 exchange reaction experiments under atmospheric pressure flow conditions in the temperature range of 300\u2500523 K. Pretreatment with flowing H2 is required for stable catalytic performance and two temperatures, 523 K and 673 K, were investigated. The experimentally-determined H2-D2 exchange rate is 5-7 times greater for npTiCu vs. the undoped Cu material under optimized pretreatment and reaction temperatures. The H2 pretreatment leads to full reduction of Cu oxide and partial reduction of surface Ti oxide species present in the as-prepared catalyst as demonstrated using in-situ ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factors measured for H2-D2 exchange are substantially different for Ti-doped vs. undoped npCu catalysts. DFT calculations suggest that isolated, metallic Ti atoms on the surface of the Cu host can act as the active surface sites for hydrogen recombination. The increase in the rate of exchange above that of pure Cu is caused primarily by a shift in the rate-determining step from dissociative adsorption on Cu to H/D atom recombination on Ti-doped Cu, with the corresponding decrease in activation entropy that it produces.

Recent experiments have shown that these performance metrics, particularly stability, can be tuned by changing the fraction of ether and fluorine content. However, little is known about how different molecular architectures influence the underlying ion transport mechanisms and conductivity. Here, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the ion transport and solvation characteristics of fluoroether chains of varying length, and having different ether segment and flu- orine terminal group contents. The design rules that emerge from this effort are that solvent size determines lithium-ion transport kinetics, solvation structure, and solvation energy. In particular, the mechanism for lithium-ion transport is found to shift from ion hopping between solvation sites located in different fluoroether chains in short-chain solvents, to ion-solvent co-diffusion in long-chain solvents, indicating that an optimum exists for molecules of intermediate length, where hopping is possible but solvent diffusion is fast. Consistent with these findings, our experimental measurements reveal a non-monotonic behavior of the effects of solvent size on lithium-ion conductivity, with a maximum occurring for medium-length solvent chains. A key design principle for achieving high ionic conductivity is that a trade-off is required between relying on shorter fluoroether chains having high self-diffusivity, and relying on longer chains that increase the stability of local solvation shells.", "date": "2022-08-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The fast ion diffusion of the electrolyte and the low resistance of the MoO3 and Mo interface resulted in an equivalent series resistance of 96 \u03a9. A cycle test indicated that the pseudo-capacitor exhibited a high capacitance retention of 82.8% after 10 000 cycles. The transient behavior was confirmed by the dissolution of the pseudo-capacitor into phosphate-buffered saline solution after 101 days. Potential applications of transient pseudo-capacitors include electronics without the need for device retrieval after use, including smart agriculture, implantable, and wearable devices.", "date": "2022-08-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Biodegradable Materials; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A direct and unique approach to evaluate such property is 3D Raman imaging. This technique characterizes the surface and inner part of preformulation samples, allowing to determine phase separation in the early stages of pharmaceutical development. Aiming to promote controlled release of the local anesthetic butamben (BTB), confocal 3D Raman microscopy was used to obtain its optimal proportion in Apifil\u00ae, Capryol\u00ae 90 and Transcutol\u00ae. Even if the microscopic images of some samples displayed very homogeneous surfaces, analysis of 3D maps showed that chemical distribution throughout the material was different. To investigate how concentration affects the homogeneity, mixture experimental design (DoE) was employed. From this analysis, it was revealed that correct amount of Capryol\u00ae 90 enhances both miscibility and solubility. Furthermore, suitable miscibility was observed in two ratio proportions of excipients: Solution 1: Apifil\u00ae 30.00%, Capryol 20.00% and Transcutol 10.00% (w/w), with a desirability of 0.783; and Solution 2: Apifil\u00ae 25.00%, Capryol 25.00% and Transcutol 10.00% (w/w), with 0.742 desirability.

This work presents the verification for correlations between geometric and spectroscopic parameters related to hydrogen bonds in this type of macrocyclic compounds. In particular, such relationships were investigated for a large group of porphyrin, porphycene, and dibenzotetraaza[14]annulene derivatives and a group of other macrocycles with similar structure. A very strong linear correlation was found only between the vibrational frequencies of the NH groups involved in a hydrogen bond and the length of this bond, which applied to all macrocyclic compounds of this type. Several other relationships were found between spectroscopic (IR, Raman, NMR) and geometric (X-ray) parameters, highlighting differences and similarities between different families of macrocycles.

However, the lack of accurate knowledge of the reaction mechanism prevents the development of engineering strategies for methane photocatalysis.

The photoactivated water dramatically promotes the activation of robust C\u2013H bond of methane, and stabilizes the \u2022CH3 intermediates in the interfacial hydrogen-bond network of water. Owing to the moderate stabilization of \u2022CH3, the overall photocatalytic conversion rates are dramatically improved by typically more than 30 times at ambient temperatures (~300 K) and pressures (~1 atm). The increase in reaction activity is noticeable also in C1 to C2 evolution of methane, although water is not explicitly involved in the reaction equation (2CH4 \u2192 C2H6 + H2).

Aiming at clarifying this point as well as at avoiding such mistakes in future studies or unraveling errors in previous literature, in the present paper\n  we formulate two theorems that any sound results on antioxidation should obey. The first theorem states that the sums of the enthalpies characterizing the individual steps of SET-PT and SPLET are equal: IP + PDE = PA + ETE (= H2). This is a mathematical identity emerging from the fact that both the reactants and the final products of SET-PT and SPLET are chemically identical.

In the current study, we have revealed the ability of apigenin and chrysin to alter cellular metabolome based on untargeted metabolomics. Based on our metabolomics data, both these structurally related flavonoids demonstrate diverging and converging properties.  Apigenin demonstrated the potential to possess anti-inflammatory and vasorelaxant properties through the upregulation of alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid metabolism intermediates. Chrysin on the other hand exhibited abilities to inhibit protein and pyrimidine synthesis along with downregulation of gluconeogenesis pathways based on the metabolites obtained. These metabolic effects were due to the impact of chrysin to modulate L-alanine metabolism and urea cycle.

Again, considering this \u03bbmax value with two FTIR peaks at 1709 cm-1 and 1315 cm-1 gave an estimation of the existence of hydrolysable tannin. The study of two Chemometrics tools, principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of FTIR spectral data combined with four standard tannins such as Mimosa, Quebracho, Chestnut, and Tara, showed a significant dissimilarity of C. decandra tannin to two condensed tannins (Mimosa and Quebracho) along with meaningful concord to two hydrolysable tannins (Chestnut and Tara). Thus, the rapid characterization using multiple analytical methods and multivariate analysis suggests a harmonious outcome for C. decandra bark, containing hydrolysable tannin.", "date": "2022-08-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Anal.

However, the direct application of collateral cleavage activity for in-situ intracellular detection is still challenging. Here, we debut a CRISPR/Cas-assisted nanoneedle sensor (nanoCRISPR) for intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which avoids the challenges associated with intracellular collateral cleavage by introducing a two-step process of intracellular target recognition followed by extracellular transduction and detection. ATP recognition occurs by first presenting in the cell cytosol an aptamer-locked Cas12a activator conjugated to nanoneedles; the recognition event unlocks the activator immobilized on the nanoneedles. The nanoneedles are then removed from the cells and exposed to the Cas12a/crRNA complex, where the activator triggers the cleavage of a ssDNA fluorophore-quencher pair, generating a detectable fluorescence signal. NanoCRISPR has an ATP detection limit of 246 nM and a dynamic range from 1.56 \u03bcM to 50 \u03bcM. Importantly, nanoCRISPR can detect intracellular ATP in 30 min in live cells without impacting cell viability.

Analysis of the electronic structure changes along the reaction path shows that two spin crossovers, facilitated by the geometry and magnetism of the water oxidising complex are used to provide a unique low energy pathway. The pathway is facilitated via formation and stabilisation of the [O2]3- ion. This ion is formed between ligated deprotonated substrate waters, O5 and O6, and is stabilised by antiferromagnetic interaction with the Mn ions of the complex. Combining  computational, crystallographic and spectroscopic data we show that  an equilibrium exists between an O5 oxo and O6 hydroxo form with an S=3 spin state and a deprotonated O6 form containing a two-centre one electron bond in [O5O6]3- which we identify as  the form detected using crystallography. This form corresponds to an S=6 spin state which we demonstrate gives rise to a low intensity EPR spectrum compared with the accompanying S=3 state, making its detection via EPR difficult and overshadowed by the S=3 form. Simulations using  70% of the S=6  component give rise to a superior fit to the experimental W- band EPR spectral envelope  compared with an S=3 only form. Analysis of the most recent X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) first moment changes for solution and time resolved crystal data are also shown to support the model.  The computational, crystallographic and spectroscopic data are shown to coalesce to the same picture of a predominant S=6 species containing the first one-electron oxidation product of two water molecules i.e. [O5O6]3-. Progression of this form to the two-electron oxidised peroxo and three-electron oxidised superoxo forms, leading eventually to the evolution of triplet O2, is proposed to be the pathway Nature adopts to oxidise water.

A multi-level factorial center composite design using response surface methodology (RSM) is applied to quantify the individual and combined effect of the current density, pH and inter-electrode distance (IED) on the COD removal from the drill site wastewater and the energy consumption of the electrocoagulation process. The increasing current density shows significant increase in COD removal. A similar trend was observed with decrease in pH  on COD removal. The model obtained from RSM study predicted the optimum current density, pH, and IED within the experimental range of the study. It was found that the optimum condition for DSW-1 samples for 78% COD removal is at 4.76 mA/cm2 and 4 pH, and for DSW-2, we get the COD removal of 64% at 19.04 mA/cm2 and 1.2 cm IED.

The novel material class of high entropy oxides with their unique and unexpected physicochemical properties is a potential candidate for energy applications. Herein, we report for the first time about the physico- and (photo-) electrochemical properties of ordered mesoporous (CoNiCuZnMg)Fe2O4 thin films synthesized by a soft-templating and dip-coating approach. The high entropy ferrites (HEF) are composed of 15 \u2012 18 nm sized and periodically ordered mesopores building a highly accessible inorganic nanoarchitecture with specific surface areas up to 170 m2/g. The mesoporous HEF thin films crystallize in the cubic spinel structure and were found to be crack-free on the meso- and macroscale. The formation of the spinel structure hosting six distinct cations was verified by means of gracing incidence X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and transmission electron microscopy accompanied with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Photoelectron spectroscopy gave insight into chemical state of the implemented transition metals supporting the structural characterization data. Analyzed as photoanode for photoelectrochemical water splitting, the HEFs showed only low photoconductivity owing to fast surface recombination as suggested by intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy. When applied as oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst, the HEF thin films possess overpotentials of 420 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH.

This transition will also shift desalination from large-scale centralized coastal facilities towards modular distributed treatment plants (~1000 m3/day) in inland locations. This new scale of desalination can be satisfied using solar energy to decarbonize water production, but additional considerations, such as storage to address intermittency and inland brine management to address high disposal costs, become important. In this work, we evaluate the levelized cost of water or LCOW for 16 solar desalination technologies (with different generation\u2013storage-desalination\u2013brine management subsystems) at 2 different salinities corresponding to nontraditional sources. For fossil fuel-driven desalination plants at the distributed scale, we find that zero liquid discharge is economically favorable to inland brine disposal. For renewable desalination, we discover that (i) solar-thermal energy is better suited to both membrane and thermal desalination plants compared to photovoltaics largely due to the low cost of thermal storage, and that (ii) energy storage, despite its higher cost, outperforms water storage on a levelized basis as the latter has a low utilization factor with intermittently operated desalination plants. The analysis also yields a promising\noutlook for the LCOW of solar desalination by 2030 as the costs of solar generation and energy storage decrease to meet the U.S. Department of Energy targets.

However, how CuII -His/His interactions are affected by molecular dynamic context remains elusive. Herein a study of heterogeneity in CuII-His/His interactions is demonstrated using a synthetic ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA)-based glycinamide-type N, O-ligand, namely, EDTA-bis(L-histidine methyl ester) (P), complemented by its analog EDTA-bis(histamine) (P'). CuII binding feature was dissected by means of electrospray ionization-high resolution mass spectrometry (ESI-HRMS) which established a simultaneous formation and coexistence of mono-CuII (1), di-CuII (2) and decarboxylated di-CuII complex (3). Comprehensive ESI-HRMS titration revealed metal-concentration-dependent interaction modes, pH-dependence in ligating-group competition and cooperation, and substituent effect on the consecutive CuII binding. Further, ESI-HRMS allowed the associated innate proton affinity (pKa ~6.46 [1 + H+], 7.82 [2 + H+], and 8.77 [3 + H+], and Na+ (K+) uptaking ability of the Cu-complexes to be determined to substantiate the above putative structural elucidation. In parallel, external-ligand (Tris, PO42-) competition experiments permitted capturing and distinguishing between the two types of di-nuclear coordination modes (anti-Cu/Cu independent vs syn-Cu/Cu mutual-dependent modes) pertaining to the di-CuII-centers in 2 and 3, respectively; the latter being Cu/Cu inter-dependent di-Cu complex, which apparently resisted external-ligand capturing, was conceivably resulted from decarboxylation of the accompanying syn-isomer of 2 (anti). Moreover, circular dichroism (CD) titration enabled an estimation that the first CuII-binding is three-fold stronger than the second CuII at neutral and basic pH, but nearly similar to the second CuII at acidic pH. Furthermore, 13C NMR assisted in illuminating that both amidate and Im groups strongly participated in CuII binding at pH 7.10. Consequently, a two-dimensional landscape (variation of pH and CuII concentration) for binding was suggested, and from which an internally non-static binding mode in the mono-CuII complex (1) was extracted to account for a dynamic transition from mono-CuII to two types of di-CuII species, due to carboxylate-group scrambling on CuII ions together with backbone \u0394-\u039b conformation change. It is concluded that the pH-dependent on-off Im-CuII, amidate-CuII, carboxylate-CuII, amide oxo-CuII and amino-CuII binding and backbone dynamics act synergistically in the mono- vs di-CuII binding.

The system is especially well suited for detecting lipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) as well as numerous sphingolipid classes and glycerolipids. For the first time, the coupling of plasma-based post-ionization with ion mobility is presented and we show the value of ion mobility for the resolution and and identification of species within rich spectra that contain numerous isobaric/isomeric signals that are not resolved in the m/z dimension alone, including isomeric PE and demethylated phosphatidylcholine lipids produced by in-source fragmentation. The reported instrument provides a powerful and user-friendly approach for MSI of lipids.", "date": "2022-08-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Imaging; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To the extent that this is true for correlated wave function methods, it is usually an artifact of low-quality basis sets, but the question has not been considered systematically in the context of density functional theory (DFT) where basis-set convergence is \ngenerally less problematic.  We present a systematic assessment of the CP procedure for a representative set of functionals and basis sets, considering both benchmark data sets of small dimers as well as larger supramolecular complexes including layered composite polymers with ~150 atoms and ligand--protein models with ~300 atoms.    We find that intermolecular interaction energies approaching complete-basis quality can be obtained using only double-zeta basis sets, provided that CP correction is applied.   This is less expensive as compared to using triple-zeta basis sets without CP correction.  CP-corrected interaction energies are also less sensitive to the presence of diffuse basis functions as compared to uncorrected energies, which is important given that diffuse functions are expensive and often numerically problematic for large systems.    Our results upend the conventional wisdom that CP \"overcorrects\" for basis-set incompleteness.   In small basis sets, CP correction is mandatory in order to demonstrate that the results do not rest on error cancellation.", "date": "2022-08-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Multireference diagnostics to estimate the magnitude of such static correlation have been primarily developed for molecular systems, with a range of computational costs from low to as costly as the full multi-reference calculation itself. We report the first application of low-cost multireference diagnostics on the solid state based on the fractional occupation number calculated with finite-temperature density functional theory (DFT). In order to compare the behavior of the diagnostics on solids and molecules, we select metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as model materials, since their reticular nature provides an intuitive way of identifying molecular derivatives. Two possible molecular fragmentations are considered: 1) breaking it down into its substituent secondary building unit and linker components and 2) extracting it in a finite cluster with a single metal atom. We demonstrate that the DFT-based multireference diagnostics are equally applicable to solids as to molecules. The magnitude and spatial distribution of the multireference character of a MOF are found to have a good correlation with those of the molecular derivatives, which can be calculated much more affordably in comparison to the full MOF.

Here, we develop them as smallest conceivable nanocrystal prototypes. We synthesize a series of zirconium and hafnium oxo clusters with ligands that are typically used to stabilize oxide nanocrystals (fatty acids with long and/or branched chains). In contrast to previously reported discrete oxo clusters with short/rigid carboxylates (e.g., acetate, benzoate), the fatty acid capped oxo clusters have a high solubility but do not crystallize, precluding traditional purification and single-crystal XRD analysis of clusters. We thus develop alternative purification strategies and structural analysis tools. We use X-ray total scattering and Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis as our main tool to elucidate the structure of the cluster core. In contrast to traditional PDF analysis of larger clusters and nanocrystals, we show that the structure models need to include the carboxylate binding groups to obtain excellent refinements. Our methodology is able to pick up the correct structure from a series of possible structure models (\\textbf{Zr4}, \\textbf{Zr6}, \\textbf{Zr12}). Further supporting evidence for the cluster composition (including their ligand shell) is provided by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and mass spectrometry (MS). We find that the ligands have multiple binding modes and that hydrogen bonded carboxylic acid is an intrinsic part of the oxo cluster. Using our analytical tools, we elucidate the conversion from \\textbf{Zr6} monomer to \\textbf{Zr12} dimer (and vice versa), induced by carboxylate ligand exchange. Finally, we compared the catalytic performance of \\textbf{Zr12}-oleate clusters with oleate capped, 3-5 nm zirconium oxide nanocrystals in the esterification of oleic acid with ethanol. The oxo clusters are much more catalytically active, due to their higher surface area. Since the oxo clusters are the limit of downscaling oxide nanocrystals, we thus propose them here as appealing catalytic materials, or at least as atomically precise model systems. In addition, our analytical (PDF) methodology is generally applicable and expected to find use in other areas of clusters as well, and will be especially valuable for clusters with weakly scattering core atoms. \n", "date": "2022-08-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Spectroscopy (Inorg.); Materials Chemistry; Crystallography \u2013 Inorganic", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

A user interface allows for creating customized selections of suitable MOF structures, looking for their porous and crystalline properties, gravimetric and volumetric total uptakes, and metallic and organic composition, as well as properties for the organic linkers like name, molecular mass, price, or presence of specific functional groups. This information was used to select potential structures from up to two metals and two linkers for the volumetric cryostorage of hydrogen.

While cyclooctatetraene (COT) is aromatic in its T1 state following Baird\u2019s 4n rule, we now reveal that the degree of Baird-aromaticity of the BN isosteres varies extensively with aromaticity aspect considered. According to energetic and electronic indices, the thermodynamically most stable octagonal B4N4H8 isomer, having alternating B and N pattern (borazocine, B4N4COT-A), is only weakly aromatic or nonaromatic in T1, while the magnetic descriptors suggest it to have about two thirds the Baird-aromaticity of T1 state COT (3COT). The extent of Baird-aromaticity of intermediate BN/CC isosteres also varies markedly with aspect investigated. On the other hand, magnetic indices indicate that borazine (B3N3H6) in its singlet ground state (S0) is weakly aromatic. This opposite features in the magnetic aromaticity descriptors of, respectively, S0 state borazine (1borazine) and 3B4N4COT-A can be linked to differences in the symmetries of the orbitals involved in the virtual transitions from occupied to unoccupied orbitals which describe the response of a molecule in an external magnetic field. For azaboraCOTs, the magnetic aspect of T1 state Baird-aromaticity (response aromaticity) is not related to the electronic and energetic aspects (intrinsic aromaticity), findings that underline earlier observations on differences between the various aspects of the aromaticity phenomenon (or phenomena).", "date": "2022-08-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Physical Organic Chemistry; Bonding; Main Group Chemistry (Inorg.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The size and distribution of these reaction vessels are the main factors in making different geometry silicone patterns; however, very little is known about the fate of these droplets throughout the polymerization. Here, we proposed keeping the relative humidity (%  RH) inside the reactor stable throughout the polymerization as a new coating parameter to force the size of the reaction vessel water droplets to be the same for building simple shape silicone rods with controlled geometry and distribution. In this manner, we grew simple geometry cylindric micro-rods on surfaces and could tune their length, diameter, inter-rod spacings, and thus the (super)hydrophobicity. Beyond fabricating simple geometry cylindrical micro rods, here, we also demonstrate that by changing the amplitude and the stability of the % RH, it is possible to fabricate different (super)hydrophobic nano-grasses, conical silicone micro-rods, and isotropic silicone nanofilaments (SNF). In the end, the proposed new way of tuning initial and in-situ reaction vessel droplet size can be used as a single factor to formulate different geometry silicone patterns with tunable dimensions, leading to different roughness and thus different degrees of hydrophobicity and superhydrophobicity. Due to its simplicity, silicone patterning with irregular spacing and size is preferred among other coating techniques, but the mathematical description of these irregular patterns is not trivial to explain their (super)hydrophobicity. To a certain extent, the droplet-size-assisted silicone shaping in this work provides a new way to control the length, diameter, morphology, inter-rod spacing, and thus the (super)hydrophobicity of the silicone patterns, especially those in the shape of simple cylindrical micro-rods. This control over silicone architecting will help to prepare new (super)hydrophobic coatings with more controlled morphology and thus wettability; on the other hand, it will support surface scientists modeling the connection between surface geometry and (super)antiwetting of such irregular pillared surfaces that remain elusive.", "date": "2022-08-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science; Coating Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Surface", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we demonstrate a computational rationale for improving the performance of weakly coordinating electrolytes in currently challenging multivalent-ion battery applications, based on enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic stability against reductive decomposition. A series of fluorinated alkoxyborate and alkoxyaluminate salts are systematically examined based on their reduction and oxidation potentials and, motivated by NMR spectroscopy, detailed reductive decomposition pathways involving the breaking of Al/B-O, C-O, or C-F bonds are obtained. Based on the decomposition kinetics, the hexafluoro-tert-isopropoxy (hfip) ligand for borates and the trifluoro-tert-butoxy (tftb) ligand for aluminates are identified as promising ligands for constructing the salt anions. This borate prediction corroborates previous experimental work on Mg[B(hfip)4]2 and Ca[B(hfip)4]2, in which excellent electrochemical properties were reported. We find that steric factors govern the B-O bond breaking decomposition kinetics while electronic factors are more important for aluminate salts. There is more charge-transfer character in the aluminate transition states compared with borates for Al/B-O bond breaking decomposition and thus electron-withdrawing ligands tend to stabilize the aluminate transition states.

Reports show that high amounts of LH2 lead to the accumulation of HLCCs, causing fibrosis and specific types of cancer metastasis. Some members of the Fe(II)/\u03b1KG-dependent family have also been reported to have intramolecular O2 tunnels, which aid in transporting one of the required co-substrates into the active site. While LH2 can be a promising target to combat these diseases, efficacious inhibitors are still lacking. We have used computational simulations to investigate a series of forty-four small molecules as lead compounds for LH2 inhibition. Tunneling analyses indicate the existence of several intra-molecular tunnels. The lengths of the calculated O2-transporting tunnels in holoenzymes are relatively longer than the apoenzyme suggesting that the ligands may affect the enzyme's structure and possibly block (at least partially) the tunnels. The sequence alignment analysis between LH enzymes from different organisms shows that all the amino acid residues with the highest occurrence rate in the oxygen tunnels are conserved. Our results suggest that the enolate form of diketone compounds establishes stronger interactions with the Fe(II) in the active site.

A hybrid model that combines incomplete physics knowledge with available measurement data within a differentiable programming framework opens up new avenues to tackle the challenges. In this work, a physics-integrated neural differentiable (PiNDiff) model is developed, where the partially known physics is integrated into the recurrent network architecture to enable effective learning and generalization. The merit and potential of the proposed method have been demonstrated in modeling the curing process of thick thermoset composite laminates, whose governing physics is partially given. The proposed PiNDiff model shows the capability to learn unknown physics from the limited, indirect data and, meanwhile, can be used to infer unobserved variables and parameters. The performance of the PiNDiff model has been compared with two state-of-the-art (SOTA) black-box deep learning models, and its advantages over the purely data-driven models and first-principles physics-based models have been discussed in detail.

We explain the unexpected formation of extended aggregates using a novel coarse-grained simulation model of P(NDI2OD-T2) that we have developed to study the effect of solvent quality on its solution-phase behaviour. In poor solvents, we find that aggregation through only a few monomers gives effectively inseparable chains, leading to the formation of extended structures of partially overlapping chains via non-equilibrium assembly. This behaviour requires that multi-chain aggregation occurs faster than chain folding, which we show is the case for the chain lengths and concentrations shown experimentally to form rod-like aggregates.

In the former (DPND6), the weak degree of mixing of intramolecular localized excited (LE) states and intermolecular charge transfer (CT) states makes the low-energy absorption band possess the predominant optical absorption, while in the latter (DPND), the CT and LE states are close in energy, together with their strong interaction,  resulting in the substantial state-mixing, so that its two low-energy absorption bands have nearly equal oscillator strengths and a wide energy spacing of more than 0.5 eV.\nThe simulation of exciton dynamics elucidates that the\nphoto-initiated states in both aggregates cannot generate the free charge carrier because of the lack of enough driving forces. However, the population exchanges between LE and CT states in DPND aggregates are much faster than in DPND6 aggregates, indicating the different SF behaviors, consistent with the experimental observation.", "date": "2022-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

While the reversibility of this process prevented isolation and structural characterisation of [PdMg2H4], analogous [PtMg2H4] and [PdZn2H4] complexes could be isolated and characterised through independent syntheses. Computational analysis (DFT, AIM, NCIPlot) of the bonding in a series of heterometallic tetrahydride compounds (Ni-Pt; Mg and Zn) suggests that these complexes are best described as square planar with marginal metal\u2013metal interactions; the strength of which increases as group 10 is descended and increases from Mg to Zn. DFT calculations support a mechanism for H2 activation involving a ligand-assisted oxidative addition to Pd. These findings were exploited to develop a catalytic protocol for H/D exchange into magnesium hydride and zinc hydride bonds.

The affinity of the final hemin conjugates towards \u25cfNO was studied experimentally and theoretically using quantum mechanics calculations with the further testing of the downstream effects on TNBC cell migration. These compounds represent model hemin derivatives, which showed differential binding to \u25cfNO with different levels of resistance towards the oxidative degradation and aggregation.

These algorithms work strictly by post-processing the data and require no additional function evaluations. This is achieved by connecting the grid points with a neighbourhood graph, allowing the topological analysis to be recast as a problem in graph theory. The flexibility of the approach is demonstrated for various applications involving analysis of the charge and magnetically induced current densities in molecules, where features of the neighbourhood graph are found to correspond to chemically relevant topographical properties, such as Bader charges. These properties converge using orders of magnitude fewer grid points than uniform-grid approaches, whilst exhibiting an appealing O(N log(N)) scaling of the computational cost. The issue of grid bias is discussed in the context of graph based algorithms and strategies for avoiding this bias are presented.

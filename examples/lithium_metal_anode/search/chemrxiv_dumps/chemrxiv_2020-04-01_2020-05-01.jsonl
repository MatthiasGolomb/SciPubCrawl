The catalytic protocol results in the transformation of sp<sup>2</sup> C\u2013F bonds to sp<sup>2</sup> C\u2013Al bonds and provides a route into reactive organoaluminium complexes (<b>2a-h</b>) from fluorocarbons. The catalyst is highly active. Reactions proceed within 5 minutes at 25 \u00baC (and at appreciable rates at even \u201350 \u00baC) and the scope includes low-fluorine-content substrates such as fluorobenzene, difluorobenzenes and trifluorobenzenes. The reaction proceeds with complete chemoselectivity (C\u2013F vs C\u2013H) and high regioselectivities ( >90% for C\u2013F bonds adjacent to the most acidic C\u2013H sites). The heterometallic complex [Pd(PCy<sub>3</sub>)(<b>1</b>)<sub>2</sub>] was shown to be catalytically competent. Catalytic C\u2013F alumination proceeds with a KIE of 1.1\u20131.3. DFT calculations have been used to model potential mechanisms for C\u2013F bond activation. These calculations suggest that two competing mechanisms may be in operation. Pathway 1 involves a ligand-assisted oxidative addition to [Pd(<b>1</b>)<sub>2</sub>] and leads directly to the product. Pathway 2 involves a stepwise C\u2013H to C\u2013F functionalisation mechanism in which the C\u2013H bond is broken and reformed along the reaction coordinate, allowing it to act as a directing group for the adjacent C\u2013F site. This second mechanism explains the experimentally observed regioselectivity. Experimental support for this C\u2013H activation playing a key role in C\u2013F alumination was obtained by employing [{(MesNCMe)<sub>2</sub>CH}AlH<sub>2</sub>] (<b>3</b>, Mes = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) as a reagent in place of 1. In this instance, the kinetic C\u2013H alumination intermediate could be isolated.

In this context, and due to their small size and intrinsic hydrophilicity, we focused on pyronin dyes and related heteroatom analogs (i.e., formal derivatives of 3-imino-3H-xanthen-6-amine and its silicon analog) for their use as optically tunable aniline-based fluorophores. To overcome some severe limitations associated with the use of such fluorogenic scaffolds (i.e., poor aqueous stability and spectral features only in the green-yellow spectral range), the synthesis of novel unsymmetrical derivatives of (Si)-pyronins bearing a single bulky tertiary aniline (i.e., N-methylindoline and julolidine) was explored and presented in this Article.

Recent research indicates that the natural host of SARS-CoV-2 may be bats, but its intermediate host is still unclear. Only by finding natural and intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 can cut off the source and prevent the virus from being transmitted to humans. In this study, we established a new method for the mining of intermediate host. We selected 82 representative ACE2 sequences from the 1000 sequences with the closest homology to the human ACE2 protein. All these selected ACE2 proteins were modeled by homology modeling. The potential natural and intermediate hosts, as well as susceptible animals of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed systematically by calculating the binding free energy of ACE2 protein with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Based on this study, Rhinolophus sinicus was suggested to be the natural host, and the virus may be transmitted directly from bats to humans. Primates, some wild Felidae, civet, goats, spotted hyenas and golden hamsters may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and could be intermediate hosts, while pangolins are unlikely to be intermediate hosts, and birds and reptiles are not intermediate hosts.

In particular, the organic electrochemical transistor (OECT), a\ndevice that employs organic semiconductors as the active material, has been\nwidely investigated as biosensors due to their low operational potentials, ability\nto operate in aqueous environments, biocompatibility, and the amplification of low-lying\nbiological signals owing to the OECTs\u2019 large transconductance. As such, OECTs\nhave been utilized as biochemical sensors for monitoring of biomarkers or\nmetabolites, with potential application for health monitoring for wearable\ndevices in combination with internet of things (IoT). </p>\n\n<p>The current working\nprinciple of biosensors based on OECTs relies on the reaction between the\nchannel material and the analyte or intentionally generated intermediates that\nundergo direct or indirect electron transfer reactions with the channel\nmaterial. This electron transfer reaction results in changes of the device\nchannel conductivity with respect to the concentration of the analyte in a\nsample. While recent work has shown progress in development of biosensors based\non this approach, it introduces several complications and disadvantages, namely\nunintended and uncontrolled chemical and electrochemical side reactions. First\nand foremost, this configuration does not allow the signal amplification one\nexpects from a transistor device, thus invalidating the most often (and we show\nhere erroneously) stated advantages of using OECTs for biosensing. Further,\ndevices designed using this approach can rapidly degrade during the operation but\nmore importantly, the results and their interpretation can lead to incorrect conclusions\nand render current devices unreliable for applications in health monitoring. </p>\n\n<p>Our work addresses these\nchallenges by i) isolating the chemical reaction from the OECT channel on a\nseparate compartment and ii) employing enzymatic reactions to form intermediates\nthat drives a reaction to power the OECT. In addition, this device architecture\neliminates the need for an external gate voltage so only a single power source\nis required to monitor changes of the conductivity of the OECT channel material.\nDoing so also allows us to <u>truly</u> amplify the reaction current on the fuel\ncell from \u00b5A up to mA across the OECT (with ON/OFF ratios of 10<sup>4</sup>), presenting\nsignificant improvements over conventional OECT biosensors that operate in the\nnA range,\nthereby eliminating the need for sophisticated measurement instrumentation. Our\nwork goes in depth in elucidating general materials design parameters for the fuel\ncell OECT. Furthermore, the device operation mechanism was rationalized using electrochemical\nand electrical measurements of a variety of state-of-the-art materials for\nOECTs.</p>\n\nThe development of this\nnew device architecture presents an exciting new direction for sensing of\nmetabolites and a low power, low cost and simple alternative approach to current\ntechnologies. Importantly, we also challenge some of the current thinking in\nthe field of OECT-based biosensing. We believe that our findings will be of\ngreat interest to researchers in the fields of bioelectronics, biofuel cells\nand organic electronics. Additionally, our findings shine light on the working\nmechanism of enzymatic biosensors with OECTs.

The non-covalent intermolecular forces that exist in organic solids not only result in a diverse set of mechanical properties, but also a critical dependence of those same properties on temperature. However, studying the thermoelastic response of solids is experimentally challenging, often requiring large single-crystals and sensitive experimental apparatus. An alternative contactless approach involves using low-frequency vibrational spectroscopy to characterize the underlying intermolecular forces, and then combining this information with solid-state density functional theory simulations to retrieve the mechanical response of materials. This methodology leverages recent advances in the quasi-harmonic approximation to predict the temperature evolution of crystalline structures, dynamics, and associated forces, and then utilizes this information to determine the elastic tensor as a function of temperature.

Standard small molecule drug discovery workflows that start with library screens are an impractical path forward given the timelines to discover, develop, and test clinically. To accelerate the time to patient testing, here we explored the therapeutic potential of small molecule drugs that have been tested to some degree in a clinical environment, including approved medications, as possible therapeutic interventions for COVID-19. Motivating our process is a concept termed polypharmacology, i.e. off-target interactions that may hold therapeutic potential. In this work, we used Ligand Design, our deep learning drug design platform, to interrogate the polypharmacological profiles of  an internal collection of small molecule drugs with federal approval or going through clinical trials, with the goal of identifying molecules predicted to modulate targets relevant for COVID-19 treatment. Resulting from our efforts is PolypharmDB, a resource of drugs and their predicted binding of protein targets across the human proteome. Mining PolypharmDB yielded molecules predicted to interact with human and viral drug targets for COVID-19, including host proteins linked to viral entry and proliferation and key viral proteins associated with the virus life-cycle. Further, we assembled a collection of prioritized approved drugs for two specific host-targets, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin B, whose joint inhibition was recently shown to block SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into host cells. Overall, we demonstrate that our approach facilitates rapid response, identifying 30 prioritized candidates for testing for their possible use as anti-COVID drugs. Using the PolypharmDB resource, it is possible to identify repurposed drug candidates for newly discovered targets within a single work day.

Key to the development of (\u2212)-OXFBD05 were fundamental studies on molecular conformation in solution and when bound to the CREBBP bromodomain. In particular, the effect of an intramolecular hydrogen bond on solution state conformation, and use of an amide bioisostere, enabled the development of (\u2212)-OXFBD05. Initial cellular studies using this ligand demonstrate that inhibition of the CREBBP/P300 bromodomain in HCT116 colon cancer cells results in lowered levels of c-Myc, and a modest but repeatable reduction in H3K18 acetylation. In hypoxia (<0.1% O<sub>2</sub>), inhibition of the CREBBP/P300 bromodomain results in enhanced stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1.

In order to examine the uncertainties underlying these results, we have derived a new polarizable force field for both calcium carbonate and bicarbonate in water based on the AMOEBA model to compare against our earlier rigid-ion model, both of which are further benchmarked against ab initio molecular dynamics for the ion pair. Both force fields consistently indicate that the association of calcium carbonate ion pairs is stable, though with an equilibrium constant that is lower than for ion pairing itself.", "date": "2020-04-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The most common class of DES refers to a mixture of a quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salt and a hydrogen bond donor (e.g., carboxylic acid) with a melting point lower than that of individual components.  DESs have recently shown promise for surface modification of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets with different functional groups.  We hypothesize that such surface functionalization of GO (and other carbon nanomaterials) with DESs can provide a new route to conjugate metallic nanoparticles onto GO surfaces (and similar).

This raises the question of how such molecules behave under extreme conditions such as when exposed to vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation. VUV photons promote molecules to highly excited states that fragment in non-statistical patterns controlled by the initial femtosecond dynamics. A detailed understanding of VUV-driven photochemistry in complex organic molecules that consist of more than one functional group is a particularly challenging task. This quantum chemical analysis reports the electronic states and ionization potentials up to the VUV range (6 - 11 eV) of the chlorine-substituted cumulenone series molecules. The valence and Rydberg properties of lone-pair terminated, \u03c0-conjugated systems are explored for their potential resonance with lone pairs from elsewhere in the system. The carbon chain elongation within the family ClHCnO, where n=1-4, influences the electronic excitations, associated wavefunctions, and ionization poten- tials of the molecules. The predicted geometries and ionization potentials are in good agreement with the available experimental photoelectron spectra for formyl chloride and chloroketene, n=1-2. Furthermore, comparison between the regular cumulenone species and the corresponding chlorinated derivatives exhibit similar behaviors especially for n=3, where the allene backbone in propadienone chloride is severely bent. Most notably for the excited states is that the Rydberg character becomes more dominant as the energy increases, with some retaining valence characters.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "2020-04-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The primary reason Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>\nis grown on these substrates in spite of having high charge storage capacity as pseudocapacitor or Lithium-ion battery electrodes on its own is to enhance its electrical conductivity and/or to impart flexibility to the electrode, which is\ndifficult for a fully metallic electrode. Higher electrical conductivity\nprolongs the cycle life of an electrode. In addition, the substrate contributes\ncapacity and thus, enhances the overall energy density of an electrode. Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4\n</sub>acts as a spacer and keeps graphene nanosheets separated when used as the\nsubstrate for capacitor electrode fabrication. This helps retain the high\nsurface area of graphene nanosheets in the electrode which contributes\nadditional capacitance. Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>supported on graphene and\nother carbon substrates have recently been investigated as catalyst for\nmethanol electro-oxidation in alkaline media; CO oxidation; and\nOxygen reduction reaction (ORR). High surface area substrate uniformly\ndistributes metal particles and prevents their agglomeration and dissolution\nduring catalytic process. In addition, high electrical conductivity of graphene\nand carbon substrates enhances the electronic conductivity of Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>\nwhich is of importance for superior catalytic activity. Composite of Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>\ncombined with carbon based substrate has also found non-electrochemical\napplication such as the removal of Pb and Cu ions from aqueous solution because\nof their adsorptive behaviour.<b></b></p>\n\n<p>A myriad of procedures have been adopted for the synthesis\nof Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> on graphene or other carbonaceous substrates. All of these methods\ninvolve one or more of the following factors that complicate the process, such\nas: long synthesis time; high synthesis temperature; use of hazardous/toxic\nchemicals; multistep process and the requirement for sophisticated device or\nhighly controlled environment. In fact, the complicacies associated with the\nsynthesis of Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> have already been acknowledged and\ninvestigations have been directed at finding relatively simpler route such as\nthe use of microwave technique. <b></b></p>\n\n<p>In this research, we report the synthesis of clusters of\nnearly octahedral shapedn Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles on few-layer\ngraphene nanoplatalet (GnP) surface through a simple, wet-chemical,\npolyethyleneimine (PEI) mediated route. Few-layer graphene nanoplatelets are\nultrathin particles of graphite prepared through proprietary intercalation and\nexfoliation method (XG Sciences, Inc., Lansing, MI, USA). The components\ninvolved in this synthesis method are manganese salts (KMnO<sub>4</sub> and MnSO<sub>4</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O); water; PEI; and GnP as the substrate. The\nsynthesis is carried out at a temperature of 80\u00b0C only and in open air. Highly\ncrystallized Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> particles, as observed by X-Ray\nDiffraction (XRD), can be synthesized on GnP surface. It has also been observed\nthat PEI acts as a reducing agent and as a capping agent on a continuous\nnetwork of ribbon-like Birnessite-MnO<sub>2</sub> (IV) to produce a nearly\noctahedral shaped nanoparticles of Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (II, III). It\nhas already been mentioned that composites of Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> on\ngraphene or other carbonaceous substrates find a myriad of applications.

Subsequent ligation with P(V)-based \u03a8 reagents takes place in high yield with exquisite selectivity for the exposed 3\u2019 or 5\u2019 alcohols on DNA. This two-stage process, dubbed SENDR for Synthetic Elaboration of Native DNA by RASS, can be applied to a multitude of DNA conformations and sequences with a variety of functionalized \u03a8 reagents to generate useful constructs.  Such entities can address numerous longstanding challenges, including the selective single coupling of DNA to proteins, ASOs, and functional small molecules, and also can allow the synthesis of doubly-labeled congeners for novel probe constructs including ones of potential interest to COVID-19 research.  Finally, a prototype for the industrialization of SENDR in a kit format is presented.", "date": "2020-04-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioorganic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The attachment is mediated by the S1 subunit of the protein via\nits receptor binding domain. Upon binding with the receptor the protein changes\nits conformation from a pre-fusion to a post-fusion form. The membrane fusion\nand internalization of the virus is brought about by the S2 domain of the spike\nprotein. From ancient times people have relied on naturally occurring\nsubstances like phytochemicals to fight against diseases and infection.  Among these phytochemicals, flavonoids and\nnon-flavonoids have been found to be the active source of different\nanti-microbial agents.  Recently, studies\nhave shown that these phytochemicals have essential anti-viral activities. We\nperformed a molecular docking study using 10 potential naturally occurring\nflavonoids/non-flavonoids against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and compared\ntheir affinity with the FDA approved drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).\nInterestingly, the docking analysis suggested that C-terminal of S1 domain and\nS2 domain of the spike protein are important for binding with these compounds.\nKamferol, curcumin, pterostilbene, and\nHCQ interact with the C-terminal of S1\ndomain with binding energies of -7.4, -7.1, -6.7 and -5.6 Kcal/mol, respectively.\nFisetin, quercetin, isorhamnetin, genistein, luteolin, resveratrol<b> </b>and\napigenin on the other hand, interact with the S2 domain of spike protein\nwith the binding energies of -8.5, -8.5, -8.3, -8.2,  -8.2, \n-7.9, -7.7 Kcal/mol, respectively.

However, experimental mechanistic studies of this important process have been extremely scarce. As a result, the mechanism of the reaction remained elusive and as of today there exist as many as three distinct mechanistic proposals. In this report, we describe systematic investigations of the dearomatizing hydroxylation of phenols using an array of experimental techniques. Kinetics, EPR spectroscopy, and reactions with radical probes demonstrate that all the previously suggested mechanisms are incorrect, and that the transformation in fact proceeds via a radical-chain mechanism, with the aryloxyl radical being the key chain-carrying intermediate. Moreover, UV and NMR spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and cyclic voltammetry show that before reacting with the aryloxyl radical, water molecule becomes activated by the interaction with the iodine(III) center, causing this formally nucleophilic substrate to act as an electrophile. The C\u2013O bond formation is identified as the rate-determining step of the reaction. This step generates the dearomatized product and an iodanyl(II) species, which is the second chain-carrying radical. The radical-chain mechanism emerging from our investigations allows to rationalize all other existing observations regarding the iodine(III)-promoted oxidative dearomatization of phenols.<br />", "date": "2020-04-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Physical Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These previous studies have established the structural requirements for FC-induced stabilization of 14-3-3\u00b7client phosphoprotein complexes; however, the effect of different 14-3-3 isoforms on FC activity has not been systematically explored. This is a relevant question for the continued development of FC variants because there are seven distinct isoforms of 14-3-3 in humans.

We have developed the colloidal synthesis of anisotropic monoclinic Nb12O29 nanoplatelets (NPLs) to investigate the dual-mode electrochromism of niobium oxide nanocrystals. The precursor for synthesizing NPLs was prepared by mixing NbCl5 and oleic acid to form a complex that was subsequently heated to form an oxide-like structure capped by oleic acid, denoted as niobium oxo cluster. By initiating the synthesis using niobium oxo clusters, preferred growth of NPLs over other polymorphs was observed. The structure of the synthesized NPLs was examined by X-ray diffraction in conjunction with simulations, revealing that the NPLs are monolayer monoclinic Nb12O29, thin in the [100] direction and extended along the b and c directions. Besides having monolayer thickness, NPLs show decreased intensity of Raman signal from Nb-O bonds with higher bond order when compared to bulk monoclinic Nb12O29, as interpreted by calculations. Progressive electrochemical reduction of NPL films led to absorbance in the near-infrared region (stage 1) followed by absorbance in both the visible and near-infrared regions (stage 2), thus exhibiting dual-mode electrochromism. The mechanisms underlying these two processes were distinguished electrochemically by cyclic voltammetry to determine the extent to which ion intercalation limits the kinetics, and by verifying the presence of localized electrons following ion intercalation using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Both results support that the near-infrared absorption results from capacitive charging and the onset of visible absorption in the second stage is caused by ion intercalation.</div>", "date": "2020-04-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanostructured Materials - Materials", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Numerous diagnostics have been proposed for identifying when MR character is likely to have an effect on the predictive power of SR calculations, but conflicting conclusions about diagnostic performance have been reached on small data sets. We compute 15 MR diagnostics, ranging from affordable DFT-based to more costly MR-WFT-based diagnostics, on a set of 3,165 equilibrium and distorted small organic molecules containing up to six heavy atoms.

The models were prospectively validated on ~840 in-house compounds screened in the same thallium flux assay. The deep neural networks performed significantly better than the classical methods with the latent descriptors. The recurrent neural networks that operate on SMILES provided highest model sensitivity.

However, the conformational dynamics and structural transitions to various intermediate states are not fully understood. Furthermore, while experimental SERT structures were complexed with drug molecules and inhibitors, the molecular basis of how the physiological substrate, serotonin, is recognized, bound, and transported remains unclear. In this study, we performed microsecond long simulations of the human SERT to investigate the structural dynamics to various intermediate states and elucidated the complete substrate import pathway.

We identified a set of crucial residues that recognize the substrate at the extracellular surface of SERT and our biochemical screening results show that mutations causes dramatic reduction in transport function. Our simulations also revealed a third sodium ion binding site coordinated by Glu136 and Glu508 in a buried cavity which helps maintain the conserved fold adjacent to the orthosteric site for transport function. The mutation of these residues results in a complete loss of transport activity.

The individual reaction steps, where the surfaces impact the 1O2 yield are deciphered, showing that 1O2 yield from superoxide disproportionation as well as the decomposition of trace H2O2 are sensitive to catalysts. Transition metal compounds in general are prone to increase 1O2. <br />", "date": "2020-04-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysts; Energy Storage; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This model allows the prediction of the adsorption energies of a variety of species (explicitly shown for C, N, O, OH, H, S, K, F) on metal alloy surfaces that include combinations of nearly all of the d-block metals.

Practical CRRC requires that\na tissue sample be disintegrated into a suspension of dispersed cells and these\ncells settle on the support surface before being analyzed by CRRC.

Effective control of the SARS-CoV2 virus that causes the COVID-19 pandemic requires both vaccines and antivirals.  Antivirals are particularly crucial to treat infected people during the period of time that an effective vaccine is being developed and deployed.  Because the development of specific antiviral drugs can take a considerable length of time, an important approach is to identify existing drugs already approved for use in humans which could be repurposed as COVID-19 therapeutics. Here we focus on antivirals directed against the SARS-CoV2 M<sup>pro</sup>  protease, which is required for virus replication. A structural similarity search showed that the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease has a striking three-dimensional structural similarity to the SARS-CoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> protease, particularly in the arrangement of key active site residues. We used virtual docking predictions to assess the hypothesis that existing drugs already approved for human use or clinical testing that are directed at the HCV NS3/4A protease might fit well into the active-site cleft of the SARS-CoV2 protease (M<sup>pro</sup>).  <i>AutoDock </i>docking scores for 12 HCV protease inhibitors and 9 HIV-1 protease inhibitors were determined and compared to the docking scores for an alpha-ketoamide inhibitor of M<sup>pro</sup>, which has recently been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV2 virus replication in cell culture. We identified eight HCV protease inhibitors that bound to the M<sup>pro</sup> active site with higher docking scores than the alpha-ketoamide inhibitor, suggesting that these protease inhibitors may effectively bind to the M<sup>pro</sup> active site. These results provide the rationale for us to test the identified HCV protease inhibitors as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV2 protease, and as inhibitors of SARS-CoV2 virus replication. Subsequently these repurposed drugs could be evaluated as COVID-19 therapeutics.<b></b></p>", "date": "2020-04-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We applied this approach to a widely studied class of electrolyte materials: oligo-ethylene glycol (OEG)-LiTFSI mixtures; the resulting model enables elucidation of fundamental physical principles that govern the properties of these electrolytes and also enables prediction of the properties of novel, improved OEG-LiTFSI-based electrolytes.

The virus specific molecular interaction with the host cell represents a promising therapeutic target for identifying SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs. The repurposing of drugs can provide a rapid and potential cure towards exponentially expending COVID-19. Thereto, high-throughput virtual screening approach was used to investigate FDA approved LOPAC library drugs against both the S-protein and ACE2 host cell receptor. Primary screening identified a few promising drugs for both the targets, which were further analyzed in details by their binding energy, binding modes through molecular docking, dynamics and simulations. Evidently, Eptifibatide acetate, TNP, GNF5, GR 127935 hydrochloride hydrate and RS504393 were found binding to virus binding motifs of ACE2 receptor. Additionally, KT185, KT203 GSK1838705A, BMS195614, and RS504393 were identified to bind at the receptor binding site on the viral S-protein.

Using molecular modeling and recent discoveries made by this lab on the structure of nucleic acids, a mechanism of action is developed for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZR) to inhibit the replication of the coronavirus disease COVID-19.  The mechanism involves: (1) binding the Cl end-element of HCQ through ionic means to adjacent phosphate groups of the uracil nucleotide; (2) forming an intermolecular hydrogen bond of an NH group of HCQ to an open oxygen element of uracil; (3) binding OH end group of HCQ through ionic means with adjacent phosphate groups of the adenine nucleotide. The mechanism of action is extended to AZR as a drug delivery vector that collects HCQ and two ions of positive two charge, such as Mg2+, Zn2+ or Ca2+, and delivers the assembly to a secondary structure of single-strand RNA. As with HCQ, the structural biology of AZR is compatible for use as a collection and delivery vesicle including: (1) open access for the Cl end element and the NH group of HCQ to align and bind with Uracil, and (2) the ability to deliver and bind through ionic coupling of the OH end group of HCQ to the adenine nucleotide.

The report suggests that potent ACE2 inhibitors can be used to treat hypertension as well as for controlling SARS-CoV infection. We here studied the effect of a selective and highly potent ACE2 inhibitor (MLN-4760) on the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) with human ACE2 by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. To this end, we docked the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 to the human native ACE2 and the ACE2 complexed with MLN-4760, and analyzed the dynamics, protein-protein and ligand-protein interactions of the complexes by MD simulation in a simulated biological condition for 100 ns. Analyzing crystallographic structures of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs in the complexes with human ACE2 showed that RBD of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 with a higher affinity than that of SARS-CoV. Results also revealed that MLN-4760 binds to ACE2 at the enzymatic active site with a high affinity and significantly alters the ACE2 protein conformation. MLN-4760 also changes the binding site and the residues involved in hydrogen and hydrophobic binding between RBD and ACE2, however, it had no major effect on the binding affinity of the interaction between RDB and ACE2. Interestingly, binding RBD to the ACE2 complexed with MLN-4760 abrogated the inhibitory effect of MLN-4760 and rescued the conformation of the ACE2 enzymatic site by reforming the closed conformation to the open native conformation. This was due to the disassociation of MLN-4760 from the enzymatic active site of the ACE2 in the result of RBD binding. Overall, these results show that MLN-4760 does neither block nor increase the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD to human ACE2 and probably had no effect on the viral entry. However, binding the spike protein to ACE2 can rescue the enzymatic function of ACE2 from its inhibitor.</p>", "date": "2020-04-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Cell and Molecular Biology; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Microbiology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this context, seven natural compounds were selected and their binding to specific peptide sequences of the coronavirus S-protein: ACE2 interface-drug binding adduct were calculated.

To conquer viral infections, the inhibition of proteases essential for proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins is a conventional therapeutic strategy. To this date, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to treat SARS-CoV-2 despite its close relation to the SARS-CoV-1 virus that caused a similar epidemic in 2003. Thus, there remains an urgent need for the development of specific antiviral therapeutics to conquer SARS-CoV-2. In order to find novel inhibitors, we computationally screened a compound library of over 687 million compounds for binding at the recently solved crystal structure of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. A screening of such a vast chemical space for SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors has not been reported before. After shape screening, two docking protocols were applied followed by the determination of pharmacokinetically relevant molecular descriptors to narrow down the initial hits. Next, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to validate the stability of docked binding modes and comprehensively quantify ligand binding energies. After evaluation of off-target binding, we report a list of 11 drug-like compounds with improved binding free energy to the target protease in contrast to the cocrystallized peptidomimetic lead compound that suffers from poor pharmacokinetic properties.

While these studies have focused on particular proteins that are known 20S CP substrates, it is currently unclear how many or what types of proteins may be affected by enhancing this degradation process. We present here a study that utilizes four 20S CP stimulators to determine how each can affect the degradation of proteins in a biochemical assay with purified proteins, an overexpressed GFP-fusion protein in cells, and the effects of stimulators using label-free quantitative proteomic analysis for a more broad understanding on their impact. The results of these studies highlight that the impact of small molecule stimulators of the 20S CP on protein degradation cannot be easily predicted. While 20S CP stimulators will likely increase the degradation of proteins that have significant disorder, such as a-synuclein and tau, we observed different impacts on the degradation of proteins less than 90% disordered. To gain greater insight into the cellular systems that may be affected by 20S CP stimulators, we analyzed the proteome of HEK-293T cells treated with two of our stimulators, AM-404 or miconazole. These results were then compared to cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib. Our results show that 20S CP stimulators affect a smaller number of proteins as compared to bortezomib. The proteomics analysis corroborates our biochemical and GFP-fusion protein results, confirming that the impact of a 20S CP stimulator on protein degradation is dependent on the stimulator. Taken together, this study reveals the dynamic nature of the 20S CP, as small molecule stimulators can have a variety of mechanisms of action to change protein degradation activity. Our studies show that 20S CP stimulation can lead to a decrease in protein levels, more so those proteins that are significantly disordered, and that small molecule stimulators can potentially be tailored to decrease certain protein types.</p>", "date": "2020-04-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Therefore, chemical tools to manipulate epigenome hold promise for both therapy and the elucidation of epigenetic mechanisms. We previously developed the chemical catalyst LANA-DSH, which binds to nucleosomes via a LANA peptide ligand, and selectively acylates proximal histone H2BK120 to the catalyst moiety by acti- vating acyl-CoAs. Thus far, however, histone acylation by a chem- ical catalyst system in living cells has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we report a chemical catalyst system, composed of a nucleo- some-binding catalyst (PEG-LANA-DSH) and a cell-permeable thioester acyl donor (NAC-acyl), that can promote regioselective lysine acylation of histones in living cells. Whereas LANA-DSH is rapidly decomposed in cells, attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the LANA moiety can prevent this undesired degradation. Increasing the size of PEG conferred LANA with greater in-cell stability, but reduced catalytic activity, indicating that there is an optimum PEG length balancing stability and catalytic activity. The optimized PEG-LANA-DSH catalyst 11 efficiently promoted H2BK120 acetylation in living cells, which subsequently sup- pressed ubiquitination of H2BK120, a mark regulating various chromatin functions, such as transcription and DNA damage re- sponse. Thus, our chemical catalyst system will be useful as a unique tool to manipulate the epigenome for therapeutic purposes or further understanding epigenetic mechanisms.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "2020-04-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemistry; Cell and Molecular Biology; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for an outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. As there are no confirmed antiviral drugs or vaccines currently available for the treatment of COVID-19, discovering potent inhibitors or vaccines are urgently required for the benefit of humanity. The glycosylated Spike protein (S-protein) directly interacts with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S-protein. As the S-protein is exposed to the surface and is essential for entry into the host, the S-protein can be considered as a first-line therapeutic target for antiviral therapy and vaccine development. In-silico screening, docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies were performed to identify repurposing drugs using DrugBank and PubChem library against the RBD of S-protein. The study identified a laxative drug, Bisoxatin (DB09219), which is used for the treatment of constipation and preparation of the colon for surgical procedures.

Although social quarantine measures have succeeded in containing the spread of the virus to some extent, the lack of a clinically approved vaccine or drug remains the biggest bottleneck in combating the pandemic. Drug repurposing can expedite the process of drug development by identifying known drugs which are effective against SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a promising drug target due to its indispensable role in viral multiplication inside the host. In the present study an E-pharmacophore hypothesis was generated using the crystal structure of the viral protease in complex with an imidazole carbaximide inhibitor as the drug target. Drugs available in the superDRUG2 database were used to identify candidate drugs for repurposing. The hits were further screened using a structure based approach involving molecular docking at different precisions. The most promising drugs were subjected to binding free energy estimation using MM-GBSA. Among the 4600 drugs screened 17 drugs were identified as candidate inhibitors of the viral protease based on the glide scores obtained from molecular docking.

Here, we describe the development of chemical probes that allow us to deconvolute which features in the ATP-binding site are responsible for the allosteric modulation of the global conformation of Src. We find that the ability of an inhibitor to modulate the global conformation of Src\u2019s regulatory domain-catalytic domain module relies mainly on the influence it has on the conformation of a structural element called helix aC. Furthermore, by developing a set of orthogonal probes that target a drug-sensitized Src variant, we show that stabilizing Src\u2019s helix aC in an active conformation is sufficient to promote a Src-mediated, phosphotransferase-independent alteration in cell morphology. Finally, we report that ATP-competitive, conformation-selective inhibitors can influence the global conformation of tyrosine kinases beyond the SFKs, suggesting that the allosteric networks we observe in Src are conserved in kinases that have a similar regulatory architecture. Taken together, our study highlights that an ATP-competitive inhibitor\u2019s interactions with helix aC can have a major influence on the global conformation of some tyrosine kinases in vitro and in cells.</p>", "date": "2020-04-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Biochemistry; Biophysics; Cell and Molecular Biology; Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Current methods warrant control over the power of two stereoisomers and the configurations are routinely assigned using the descriptors ( R ) and ( S ), or related binary codes. In contrast, conformational analysis ranges beyond this dualistic treatment of stereoisomerism, which constitutes an unmet challenge for catalyst stereocontrolled processes. Herein, we now report that sixfold stereogenicity can be governed by stereoselective catalysis. By controlling a configurationally stable stereogenic axis with six large rotational barriers, a catalytic [2+2+2]-cyclotrimerization selectively governs the formation of one out of six stereoisomers with up to 0:0:2:98:0:0 stereocontrol.

Due to their intrinsic complexity, the water/metal interfaces cannot yet be adequately described by quantum mechanical approaches and accurate force-\ufb01elds are therefore needed. We develop and parametrize GAL19, a novel force-\ufb01eld to describe the interaction of water with two facets (111 and 100) of \ufb01ve metals (Pt, Pd, Au, Ag, Cu). To increase transferability compared to its predecessor GAL17, the water-metal interaction is described as a sum of pair-wise terms. The interaction energy has three contributions: (i) physisorption is described via a Tang and Toennies potential, (ii) chemisorption and surface corrugation relies on an attractive Gaussian term and (iii) the angular dependence is explicitly included as a truncated Fourier series. 13 parameters are used for each metal surface and were \ufb01tted on 250 water adsorption energies computed at the PBE+dDsC level. </div><div>The performance of GAL19 was evaluated on a set of more than 600 DFT adsorption energies for each surface, leading to an average root mean square deviation (RMSD) of only 1 kcal/mol, correctly reproducing the adsorption trends: strong on Pt and Pd but weaker on Ag, Au and Cu. This force-\ufb01eld was then used to simulate the water/metal interface for all ten surfaces for 1 ns. Structural analyses reveal similar tendencies for all surfaces: a \ufb01rst, dense water layer that is mostly adsorbed on the metal top sites, and a second layer up to around 6 \u00c5, which is less structured. On Pt and Pd, the \ufb01rst layer is strongly organized with water lying \ufb02at on the surface. The pairwise additive functional form allows to simulate the water adsorption on alloys, which is demonstrated at the example of Ag/Cu and Au/Pt alloys. The water/Ag-Cu interface is predicted to be disordered with water mostly adsorbed on Cu which should exacerbate the Ag reactivity. On the contrary, incorporating Pt into Au materials leads to a structuring of the water interface. Our promising results make GAL19 an ideal candidate to get representative sampling of complex metal/water interfaces as a \ufb01rst step towards accurate estimation of free energies of reactions in solution at the metal interface.</div>", "date": "2020-04-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Since molecular oxygen is a diradical and most organic molecules have no unpaired-electrons, reactions catalysed by oxygenases involve changes in the spin state of the system that are forbidden in non-relativistic quantum theory. To overcome this limitation, oxygenases usually require metal or redox cofactors for catalysis. Intriguingly, some oxygenases can catalyse oxygen incorporation reactions even in the absence of any cofactor, but the detailed mechanism followed by these enzymes to overcome this limitation is still unknown. In the present work we give insight onto the mechanism for the enzymatic cofactor-independent oxidation of 3,5-dihydroxyphenylacetyl-CoA (DPA-CoA) by the combination of multi-reference calculations on a model system, with QM/MM calculations for the enzymatic reaction. Our results reveal that intersystem crossing takes place without requiring concerted protonation of molecular oxygen. We characterized and identifed the nine concurrent electronic states, showing that a first electron transfer is concomitant with the triplet-singlet transition (intersystem crossing). The enzyme apparently plays a passive role in promoting the intersystem crossing, although spontaneous reorganization of the water-wire connecting the active site with the bulk presets the substrate for subsequent chemical transformations.

Both the viruses enter the host cell by binding of the viral spike glycoprotein to the host receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

Curcumin, a naturally occurring phytochemical in Curcuma longa, is known to have broad pharmacological properties. In the present study, curcumin and its derivatives were docked, using Autodock 4.2, onto the 6CRV and 6M0J to study their capability to act as inhibitors of the spike protein and thereby, viral entry.

GEK-based optimization has many advantages compared to conventional - step-restricted second-order truncated expansion - molecular optimization methods. In particular, the surrogate model given by GEK can have multiple stationary points, will smoothly converge to the exact model as the number of sample points increases, and contains an explicit expression for the expected error of the model function at an arbitrary point. Machine learning is, however, associated with abundance of data, contrary to the situation desired for efficient geometry optimizations. In the paper we demonstrate how the GEK procedure can be utilized in a fashion such that in the presence of few data points, the surrogate surface will in a robust way guide the optimization to a minimum of a potential energy surface. In this respect the GEK procedure will be used to mimic the behavior of a conventional second-order scheme, but retaining the flexibility of the superior machine learning approach. Moreover, the expected error will be used in the optimization to facilitate restricted-variance optimizations (RVO). A procedure which relates the eigenvalues of the approximate guessed Hessian with the individual characteristic lengths, used in the GEK model, reduces the number of empirical parameters to optimize to two - the value of the trend function and the maximum allowed variance. These parameters are determined using the extended Baker (e-Baker) and part of the Baker transition-state (Baker-TS) test suites as a training set. The so-created optimization procedure is tested using the e-Baker, the full Baker-TS, and the S22 test suites, at the density-functional-theory and second order M\u00f8ller-Plesset levels of approximation.

In this\nstudy we did a complete bioinformatic analysis, sequence alignment, comparison\nof multiple sequences and homology modelling of the <a>SARS-CoV-2\n</a>whole genome sequences, the spike protein and the polyproteins for homology\nwith known proteins, we also analysed receptor binding sites in these models\nfor possible binding with ligands that exhibit antiviral properties. Our\nresults showed that the tertiary structure of the polyprotein isolate SARS-CoV-2_HKU-SZ-001_2020\nhad 98.94 percent identity with SARS-Coronavirus NSP12 bound to NSP7 and NSP8\nco-factors. <a>Our results indicate that a part of the\nviral genome </a><a>(residues   3268 -3573 in  Frame 2 with \n306  amino acids) of  the SARS-CoV-2 virus isolate Wuhan-Hu-1\n(Genbank Accession Number MN908947.3) </a>when modelled with template 2a5i of the PDB database  had 96 percent identity with a 3C like\npeptidase of SARS-CoV which has ability to bind with Aza-Peptide Epoxide (APE)\nwhich is known for  irreversible\ninhibition of SARS-CoV main peptidase. Docking profile with 9 different conformations\nof the ligand with the protein model using Autodock Vina showed an affinity of\n-7.1  Kcal/mol. This region was conserved\nin 831 genomes of SARS-CoV-2. The part of the genome (residues   1568-1882 in Frame 2 with 315 amino acids) when\nmodelled with template 3e9s of the PDB database had 82 percent identity with a\npapain-like protease/deubiquitinase which when complexed with ligand GRL0617\nacts as inhibitor which can block SARS-CoV replication. Docking profile with 9\ndifferent conformation of the ligand with  the protein model using Autodock Vina showed\nan affinity of -7.9  Kcal/mol. This\nregion was conserved in 831 genomes of SARS-CoV-2. It is possible that these ligands\ncan be antivirals of SARS-CoV-2. </p><p></p><p></p>", "date": "2020-04-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

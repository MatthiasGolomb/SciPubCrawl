Self-play search algorithms, trained with simulated experience, reach state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods typically plan in the molecular rather than the reaction space, leading to redundant or near-duplicate reaction outcomes in the search tree. In this work, we introduce a reaction-centric planning approach that measures the novelty of proposed reactions, thereby constraining the search problem to genuinely unexplored disconnection ideas, i.e., unique ways of decomposing molecules using reactions. Our results show that the overall synthesis planning search space is much smaller than expected due to the absence of diverse disconnection ideas within the underlying retrosynthesis neural network. Surprisingly, we also find that, under a reasonable time budget of less than an hour, online search algorithms outperform state-of-the-art self-play methods and are more robust to environmental changes, such as minor modifications to the available purchasable building blocks.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Acrylamide (AA) is depolymerized from poly-acrylamide under harsh environmental conditions, such as exposure to UV radiation and elevated temperatures, causing severe water and soil pollution. Herein, in situ reconstructed Ag-doped Ni2P nanosheets on Ni foam (CV-Ag-Ni2P/NF) are developed as a bifunctional catalyst. This catalyst exhibits high activity for the AA oxidation reaction (AOR) and enables simultaneously energy-efficient electrolytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) processes. After cyclic voltammetry (CV) treatment, the previous zipper-like catalyst morphology transforms into a spherical morphology with interspersed rod-like structure particles on the surface, resulting in a unique structure with a larger electrochemical area and a higher quantity of active sites. The stability of CV-Ag-Ni2P/NF for both HER and AOR was established with chronopotentiometry tests. Post-characterizations by SEM, XRD and EDX analyses further suggest long-time stability of CV-Ag-Ni2P/NF. Particularly, the potential for AOR using CV-Ag-Ni2P/NF is minimized to 1.82 V generating a current density of 100 mA cm2 in the two-electrode setup. Significantly, 79.3% of AA was removed after 24 h of AOR processing at 50 mA cm2. Simultaneously, the ethanol generated at the anode serves as a value-added product for industrial application. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Ag atoms act as the active sites for the degradation of AA to produce ethanol in the hybrid structure, while the Ag atoms exhibit a more thermoneutral value for *H2O and AA adsorption. The coupling of AA oxidation with H2 production in a single system can efficiently reduce energy consumption during the treatment of AA in aqueous solutions, while generating high-value products.", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Electrochemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Ibele; Richard Bleyer; Leticia Gonz\u00e1lez", "abstract": "Surface hopping is a widely used method for simulating nonadiabatic dynamics, in which nuclear motion follows classical trajectories and electronic transitions occur stochastically. To ensure energy conservation during these transitions, atomic velocities must be adjusted. Traditional velocity rescaling methods either apply a uniform adjustment to atomic velocities, which can lead to size consistency issues, or rely on nonadiabatic coupling vectors, which are computationally expensive and may not always be available. Here, we introduce two novel velocity rescaling methods that incorporate atomic contributions to electronic transitions, derived from the one-electron transition density matrix or the density difference between states for a given transition. The first method, excitation weighted velocity rescaling, redistributes kinetic energy among atoms proportionally to their contributions to the electronic transition. This is achieved through a weighted scaling factor, computed from the population analysis of the one-electron transition density matrix or the density difference of the two states involved in the transition. The second method, excitation-thresholded velocity rescaling, adjusts the velocities only of atoms whose contributions exceed a predefined threshold, preventing unnecessary energy redistribution to atoms with minimal involvement in the excitation. We validate these approaches through excited-state dynamics simulations of fulvene and 1H-1,2,3 triazole. Our results show that excitation-weighted velocity rescaling closely reproduces the adjustments based on nonadiabatic coupling vectors for both fulvene and 1H-1,2,3-triazole.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The main new feature in Genarris 3.0 is the ``Rigid Press\" algorithm, which uses a regularized hard-sphere potential to compress the unit cell and achieve a maximally close-packed structure based on purely geometric considerations without performing any energy evaluations. In addition, Genarris 3.0 is interfaced with machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to accelerate the exploration of the potential energy landscape. We present a new clustering and down-selection workflow that employs the MACE-OFF23(L) MLIPs to perform geometry optimization and energy ranking in the early stages. We use Genarris 3.0 to successfully predict the structure of six targets: aspirin, Target I and Target XXII from previous CSP blind tests, and the energetic materials HMX, CL-20, and DNI. We further analyze the performance of MACE-OFF23(L) compared to dispersion-inclusive density functional theory (DFT) for geometry relaxation and energy ranking. We find significant variability in the performance of MACE-OFF23(L) across chemically diverse targets with particularly poor performance for energetic materials, which is mitigated by our clustering and down-selection procedure.

As these polymers make up more than 50% of the worldwide polymer production, studying their conversion during ball milling is especially relevant. However, fundamental knowledge on the effect of crystallinity, degree of polymerization, entanglement and temperature on the conversion is lacking due to the difficulty in producing polyolefins with controlled chain length and polydispersity. Here we synthesize PE by a controlled chain growth polymerization and study its degradation during ball milling at cryogenic conditions, at room temperature (RT), with and without air, and using either steel or zirconia grinding spheres. Resulting molecular weight distributions are fitted using a statistical chain cleavage model suggesting a statistical Gaussian distribution of chain cleavage probability around the middle of the chain, which likely arises from the need to fix the chains at both sides of the cleavage location. Chain cleavage preferably occurs in entangled domains linking crystalline regions. A micelle grown single crystal ultra-high molecular weight PE without entanglements was milled and its molar mass decreased much less compared to the same sample that was annealed to create entanglements. However, in contrast to previous studies and common expectations, the initial molar mass of the polymer, the degree of crystallinity and the brittleness of the sample did not have a measurable influence on chain cleavage. While the decrease in molar mass was faster at cryogenic conditions compared to RT, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results suggest that this is due to a suppression of radical recombination rather than the higher brittleness of the material below its glass transition temperature (~-120 \u02daC). Similarly, the number of permanent scissions increased by up to 2.6 times under air compared to nitrogen atmosphere, especially in combination with steel milling spheres. NMR spectra of the milled samples suggest that the reaction of mechanochemically formed chains with air suppresses recombination.

These improvements include the introduction of a modular system to add arbitrary pairwise potentials to models, CUDA-accelerated optimization for faster and more memory-efficient calculation of local atomic features, and a batched system for better performance of network ensembles, among others. Our benchmarks demonstrate that TorchANI 2.0 achieves significant speedup over previous versions in both training and inference, and the library enhancements allow users to train physically constrained models that better represent important qualities of chemical systems. We demonstrate this by introducing three new ANI models that incorporate these features and evaluating their capabilities", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

While Faraday cages are ubiquitously used for this purpose, they are often implemented simply as metal boxes enclosing the measurement system, without accounting for critical design factors such as skin depth. In this study, we have investigated a host of factors to understand noise origins, noise coupling pathways, and systematic treatment for effective shielding against them beyond the common metal box treatment. To accomplish this, we pursued the construction of a nested Faraday system conducive for low-noise data acquisition, investigating powerline quality, grounding strategies for the Faraday cage, connectivity solutions for maintaining Faraday cage integrity, and relative positioning of the components in the measurement setup. Our findings have rendered noise in current measurements to be in the vicinity of biological nanopores. For example, with 100 mM KCl, the RMS current (Irms) at 10 kHz was found to be 4.1\u00b10.1 pA, while that of \u03b1-hemolysin is reported to be ~2-3 pA. This low noise floor has allowed us to detect translocation of DNA under challenging low electrolyte conditions (i.e., 10 mM KCl) using the highest lowpass filter setting of the Axopatch 200B (i.e., 100 kHz). Moreover, with necessary modifications, these findings were extended to the MHz-level bandwidth regime, where events up to 10 MHz of sampling rate were observed with unfiltered traces. Although our findings broadly cater to solid-state nanopore (SSN) sensing, their applicability should extend beyond SSNs into other sensitive electronic systems.

To find microbial natural products that might bind and inhibit both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 at the same time, acting as dual-entry blockers, we used a fully web-based, in silico screening methodology in this investigation. Using RDKit, the 3D structures of nine structurally distinct microbial metabolites were created from 2D SDF files. CB-Dock2, a cavity-guided docking server, was used to perform molecular docking against ACE2 (PDB ID: 6M18) and TMPRSS2 (PDB ID: 7MEQ). Utilizing AutoDock Vina scores, binding affinities were evaluated, and the best protein\u2013ligand complexes underwent additional analysis. Strong dual binders were defined as compounds with Vina scores of \u2264 \u20138.0 against both targets. The best possibilities were Staurosporine (\u20139.3, \u20138.0), Rapamycin (\u201311.0, \u20138.6), and Dactinomycin (\u201312.5 for ACE2, \u20139.8 for TMPRSS2). The chemical diversity of the hits was supported by Tanimoto similarity analysis, which verified little structural repetition among the screened compounds. Venn diagrams were used to provide visual representations of binding overlap, while heatmaps were used to show structural similarities. According to this study, several microbial natural compounds may target ACE2 and TMPRSS2 at the same time, making them potential broad-spectrum antiviral leads.

Murakami; Naoyuki Nishimura", "abstract": "The recent emergence of spontaneous heterointerface modulators (SHMs) has led to a potent advancement in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Practical PSCs comprise multiple layers; therefore, modulating their defect-prone heterointerfaces is crucial for achieving highly efficient PSCs. SHMs are introduced as additives in precursor solutions of PSC components and spontaneously modulate these heterointerfaces during the deposition process. Consequently, SHMs enhance the efficiency of the PSC fabrication process. Despite the advantageous of SMHs in terms of engineering aspects, their intrinsic concentration sensitivities limit their applicability. Thus, a general strategy is necessary to mitigate these sensitivities and exploit their advantages in device engineering. Herein, we propose a novel strategy, postulating that the volatile components in SHMs can address their concentration sensitivity issue. This strategy is demonstrated by engineering volatile cations in tetrafluoroborate (BF\u2084)-based SHMs. BF4 salts of ammonium (NH\u2084\u207a), methylammonium (MA\u207a), and formamidinium (FA\u207a), which are cations of different volatilities, were used as additives for formamidinium lead halide (FAPbI3) perovskite photoabsorbers, and their effects are compared. The optimal amount of each BF\u2084-based SHM was effective for enhancing the photovoltaic performance of PSCs via their SHM functions, with similar outcomes achieved for all cation types. This indicates that BF4\u207b anions play a pivotal role in optimal SHM functionality. Meanwhile, cation composites affect their concentration sensitivity; NH4BF4, comprising the most volatile cation led to the most moderate concentration sensitivity, strongly suggesting that volatility is an instrumental factor in the design of BF\u2084-based SHMs. The proposed strategy of leveraging the volatility of SHM components to remove unused species can be applied in the development of general SHMs and as such will be helpful in addressing the intrinsic issue of SHMs. These findings support broader implementation of spontaneous heterointerface modulation technics and allow innovation in SHM design, ultimately promoting the development of high-performance PSCs.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A key limitation of in vitro P450 biocatalysis with anthracycline substrates is the rapid reductive de-glycosylation in the presence of electron donors like NADPH and ferredoxin reductase leading to inactive aglycones. This undesired reaction derails late-stage oxidative functionalization of anthracycline derivatives for clinical development. Recently, we demonstrated that DnrV, a previously uncharacterized vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) protein in the doxorubicin BGC, prevents reductive activation thereby mitigating the cellular redox stress and metabolite destruction associated with redox cycling. In this study, we employed biochemical, biophysical, and structural methods to elucidate the molecular basis of DnrV function. Our analyses revealed that DnrV is a multifunctional protein that simultaneously modulates the redox characteristics of the bound anthracycline and induces catalytic rate enhancement of the iterative cytochrome P450 DoxA. These are novel functions of the ancient VOC protein family, representing a new functional class we term REdox-Associated CytoToxin binding protein (REACT). Homologues of DnrV from non-anthracycline BGCs display similar redox-protective activity, and some extend this function to the bacterial metabolite menadione.

Free energy maps revealed that H3O+ ions are strongly trapped near SO3- groups within the polymer while water molecules (H2O) exhibit broader free energy wells. Conduction path and structural factor analyses indicated that the water channels in Nafion form interconnected tubular networks, whose tube diameter increases with hydration. The simulated structure factors quantitatively reproduced the experimentally observed correlation length of the water channels. Analysis of the mean square displacement and probability distributions of the squared displacements revealed hierarchical dynamics modes for both H3O+ and H2O. The suggested transport processes were the following three modes with different time/spatial scales: (i) localized binding to the sulfonate groups on Nafion, (ii) confined diffusion within the water channels, and (iii) normal diffusion along the water channels. From these findings, the proton diffusion modes in Nafion are all highly localized and governed by multiscale mechanisms owing to the membrane morphology and hydration.

However, for intrinsically stretchable OLEDs, the performance is still considerably inferior to commercial, non-stretchable OLEDs, with inefficient electron injection being one of the main limiting factors. Herein, we present stretchable designs for both the electron transport layer (ETL) and the cathode in stretchable OLEDs, which achieves an ideal energy-level alignment with the emitting layer for efficient electron injection. For the ETL, we design a copolymer structure combining electron-deficient conjugated groups and alkyl chains, achieving balanced electron transport and stretchability. With ideal electron and exciton energy levels, the stretchable polymer ETL enables OLED performance comparable to that of commonly used small-molecule ETL. For the cathode, we leverage the embrittlement effect of liquid metals to confer stretchability to aluminum thin films, without compromising its electrical and optical characteristics. Combining these designs, we demonstrate fully stretchable OLED devices with a record-high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8% and a record-low turn-on voltage of 3.5 V, which are on par with the performance of the utilized emitter measured in rigid OLED devices.

In this study, we introduce a machine learning approach termed Molecular Arms Race Classifier (MARC), which predicts the molecular targets \u2013 specifically sodium, potassium, and calcium ion channels \u2013 of cysteine-rich venom peptides. The MARC model was trained, cross-validated, and tested on 5,165 peptide and protein sequences sourced from in-house venom gland transcriptomes and public databases spanning diverse taxa, including sea anemones, snakes, scorpions, spiders, cone and terebrid snails. As a machine learning-based classifier of ion channel specificities, the MARC model captures the venom peptides' molecular features consisting of structural and sequence information with ESM and ProtLearn. Key findings from our analysis include the identification of 29 novel terebrid snail venom peptides, teretoxins, predicted to target potassium ion channels. Notably, most predicted potassium channel modulators (19 of 29) were classified with a distinct venom peptide cysteine framework, Framework 9. These predictions were further tested using molecular docking and dynamics simulations, validating the robustness of our MARC algorithm.

Here, an efficient scaffold-associated system is developed for efficient discovery and production of terpenoids. A self-assembling scaffold is employed to recruit enzymes of the precursor pathway, thereby enhancing precursor synthesis. This scaffolded upstream module not only improves substrate tolerance but also significantly boosts catalytic efficiency, resulting in gram-per-liter-scale production of a eunicellane diterpene with simple shake-flask fermentation. The compatibility of the system is verified by introducing multi-enzyme pathways, yielding high-level production of lycopene with a relatively 9-fold higher efficiency than the MVA pathway.

However, the influence of ligands on ultrafast carrier dynamics remains unclear. In this study, we synthesized triphenylphosphine (TPP)-derivatized Au11 clusters with different substituent groups and analyzed their excited-state dynamics using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and large-scale hybrid density functional theory calculations without simplifying the AuC structures. Although the Au11 core structure remained nearly identical, the excited-state dynamics varied.

Current oligonucleotide-based drug optimization strategies to overcome such issues often rely on applying a few commonly used chemical architectures (patterns of linker, sugar, or base modifications), which are conventional in the field, or engaging in expensive and time-consuming trial-and-error screening processes involving both sequence changes and positional chemical modifications.

Our data unequivocally demonstrates that ASO toxicity is strongly influenced by the interplay between nucleotide sequence, chemical modifications, and the specific position context of those modifications, highlighting the critical need to rationally engineering the optimal sequence and chemical composition to develop safe and active ASO drug candidates instead of discovering suboptimal ASOs through trial-and-error screening campaigns.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To formulate the force route to the diffusion constant, memory functions were calculated here from molecular dynamics simulations of six charge mutants of the green fluorescent protein and the plastocyanin protein in a wide range of temperatures. The memory time falls between the velocity and force relaxation times, with Kirkwood equation overestimating diffusion constants of proteins by a factor of ~4.

A common route to installing fluorine involves C-F bond cleavage, which is often accomplished using second- or third-row transition metals. Base metal catalysts such as nickel may provide a facile, sustainable, and cheaper alternative for C-F activation. Monodentate N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) nickel complexes have been reported to undergo C-F activation, however bis-bidentate NHC (RNHC2R1; R, R1 = alkyl or aryl) analogs remain underexplored.

Comparisons include a reference nickel(0) complex with two monodentate NHC ligands, and results show that low-valent nickel NHC complexes readily break the C-F bond in C6F6 via oxidative addition.

However, from an engineering standpoint, the controlled prepartion of DNA condensates with uniform size and well-defined structure remains a major challenge due to the stochastic nature of the condensation process. This study presents a novel approach that employs vibration-induced local vortices (VILV) within a microfluidic platform to achieve spatial control over DNA condensate dimensions and enable their parallel generation. A key advantage of this platform is its ability to support direct observation and real-time tracking of structural morphology and dynamics. Through flow-field analysis of the VILV system, we demonstrate that uniform microvortices serve as virtual compartments, wherein DNA molecules confined within each vortex space aggregate and gradually relax into uniform spherical condensate droplets. By modulating parameters such as DNA concentration and micropillar dimensions, the VILV platform not only enables systematic control of condensate size but also facilitates the construction of complex, multicomponent \"patchy\" condensates with consistent morphology.

These proteins are frequently labeled \u201cundruggable,\u201d not because they cannot be modulated, but because their ligandable sites are hidden, transient, or mutant-specific. To address this, I developed a machine-guided, biophysically grounded pipeline that dynamically reveals cryptic pockets emerging only under specific conformational and hydration conditions. This pipeline integrates long-timescale molecular dynamics (MD), Markov State Modeling (MSM), time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA), voxel-based hydration thermodynamics (\u0394G_water), and ligand\u2013residue contact persistence analysis to predict when and where a cryptic pocket forms\u2014and whether it is physically capable of supporting ligand binding.  Unlike traditional docking or e-pharmacophore workflows, my pipeline explicitly resolves conformational ensembles into metastable macrostates and ranks them by a novel Cryptic Dynamic Druggability Score (CDDS). CDDS integrates pocket lifetime, water displacement energetics, and contact persistence, providing a state-specific and interpretable druggability metric. The entire framework was applied across four challenging cancer targets: KRAS G12D, MYC Arg58Ala, TP53 Arg248Ser, and SRC kinase. In each case, I identified either (a) a cryptic pocket emerging selectively in the mutant with supportive hydration and binding energetics, or (b) a false positive that failed all dynamic criteria, despite high static druggability scores.  In KRAS G12D, a side-chain gate absent in the wild-type opened to form a metastable pocket with CDDS ~0.55, \u0394G_water \u2248 \u20133.8\u202fkcal/mol, and mutant-selective ligand binding. In MYC Arg58Ala, a cryptic site not present in the wild-type formed via side-chain deletion and surface charge inversion; a designed compound (Compound 32) bound with MM/GBSA \u2248 \u201321\u202fkcal/mol and persistent PLIP contacts. SRC kinase, a classical toxicity-prone ATP-site target, revealed a cryptic site outside the active site. This site was captured dynamically and bound Analog 7 with high affinity (\u0394G \u2248 \u201331\u202fkcal/mol) without touching the ATP pocket. In contrast, TP53 Arg248Ser showed a high Fpocket static score (0.708) but failed to sustain a pocket during MD. No meaningful ligand retention, water displacement, or stable macrostate pocket volume was observed\u2014illustrating the power of CDDS and dynamics to reject false positives.  The platform also incorporates a novel pharmacophore merging strategy using privileged scaffolds from FDA-approved and 3D-rich fragment libraries, guided entirely by dynamic pocket features rather than known ligands. Collectively, this approach enables rational design against targets previously inaccessible, de-risks biophysical assays by guiding when and where to probe, and offers a reproducible computational method for fragment hit validation, NMR probing, or soaking trials.  This work provides the first integrated, mutation-specific, dynamic cryptic pocket discovery framework validated across multiple targets. It represents a paradigm shift from structure-based design to time-aware, water-sensitive, functionally annotated druggability profiling.

Metal-amino acid frameworks (MAFs), composed of amino acids or short peptides and metal ions, are intended to imitate natural biological processes and represent some of the most intriguing examples of precisely engineered networks due to their complex and unique topologies.

In this study, we investigated the anhydrous proton conductivity of single crystals of imidazolium dihydrogen phosphate (1), a material in which rotational motion of both the acid and base components is expected to contribute to the conduction mechanism. By controlling the crystallization conditions, we successfully and selectively prepared two polymorphs: a thermodynamically stable, non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic form (1A) and a metastable, centrosymmetric monoclinic form (1B). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of the stable phase 1A revealed an anisotropic crystal structure with one-dimensional hydrogen-bonding phosphate chains connected with N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds with imidazolium.

Recent work showed that pyroplastic can have significant quantities of parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) up to 278 Da with unique distributions. Because of this enrichment, we considered whether large PAHs (> 24 ringed-carbons) could serve as chemical markers for pyroplastics. To address this, we developed a high-temperature gas chromatography atmospheric pressure ionization (GC-APCI) method, targeting large PAHs with molecular weights ranging from 314 to 424 Da, using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).Method development was performed using National Institute of Standards and Technology standard reference materials (SRMs) previously characterized for PAHs greater than 302 Da. A PAH class-specific MS/MS acquisition scheme combined with a simple, generic microextraction provided sensitive and specific detection without the need for sample fractionation or cleanup. Pyroplastics collected during the 2021 M/V X-Press Pearl ship fire and plastic spill were analyzed. Semi-quantitative comparison shows that the pyroplastic samples contain over two orders of magnitude higher amounts of the total 16 large PAHs (\u2265 24 ringed-carbons, 314 to 424 Da) than were found in unburnt plastic pellets, reflecting trends previously observed for parent PAHs up to 278 Da. Qualitative comparison of samples and SRMs revealed multiple potential candidates suitable for further study as markers of pyroplastics in complex environmental samples.

The introduction of weak/cleavable bonds into the backbone of networks via a comonomer approach was shown to impart degradability/recyclability of the object once treated with acid or base solutions. Yet, practical degradability is limited by the diffusion of this solution within the network. Many cases would rather require programmable destruction after the object's service life, with built-in degradability.

However, two main drawbacks limit its use in therapeutic and diagnostic applications: high immunogenicity and endogenous biotin interference. We propose that a mirror-image biotin/streptavidin system could solve these problems due to the minimal immunogenicity of mirror-image (D-) proteins and the expected lower binding affinity between non-natural D-streptavidin and natural D-biotin. To comprehensively address this problem, we first synthesized the L- and D-enantiomers of streptavidin using a three-segment native chemical ligation approach. This synthesis was enabled by temporarily solubilizing an aggregation-prone peptide segment with a Glu-based AlHx \u2018helping hand\u2019 linker. We developed a novel high-efficiency folding protocol and characterized the synthetic proteins by circular dichroism, size-exclusion chromatography, and binding to natural D-(+) -biotin and the mirror-image L-(-)-biotin via isothermal titration calorimetry. We found a 200-million-fold difference in affinity between streptavidin and its matched vs. mismatched biotin enantiomers that renders these systems functionally orthogonal. To gain further insight into how (-)-biotin binds recombinant streptavidin, we solved high-resolution X-ray crystal structures for both the matched and mismatched interactions. This work demonstrates the high degree of stereospecificity of the streptavidin/biotin interaction and the potential utility of a mirror-image biotin/streptavidin system for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

However, direct comparison of the accuracies of these methods is oftentimes challenging due to differences in studied systems, simulation parameters and system setup across studies. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel and well-defined model system for benchmarking water sampling methods: a closed, custom-defined C90 fullerene. Unlike conventional fullerenes with nonpolar, hydrophobic cavities, our custom-defined fullerene incorporates partial charges creating a polar cavity that energetically favors water binding. Due to a significant free energy barrier imposed by the fullerene wall, water exchange between the cavity and bulk solvent is essentially impossible on MD timescales.  To allow solvent water to equilibrate in the cavity, we introduce a solvent inlet, by performing Hamiltonian replica exchange (i.e., HREX) simulations, which reveal that our polar fullerene cavity can accommodate a maximum of two waters. From these HREX simulations, we also identify the binding sites of waters and their occupancies inside the cavity, which show that fullerene conformations with 2 or 1 waters inside the cavity are dominant, with nearly equal free energies. We further validate a non-equilibrium switching (NES) protocol for calculating the free energy of displacing a water from the conformations with 2 waters inside the cavity. Our NES results agree within statistical error with those obtained from HREX.  Our findings establish the polar fullerene as a well-defined reproducible test system for rigorously benchmarking current as well as future enhanced sampling techniques targeting slow water sampling in confined environments.

The redox potential difference between these environments can drive the formation of organic molecules by coupling CO\u2082 reduction with H\u2082 oxidation at two different pHs.\nIn this study, we validate the robustness of this model through electrochemical experiments, treating the system analogously to a short-circuited fuel cell. Using an H-type electrochemical cell, we place two electrodes in separate compartments and measure the open-circuit potential (OCP) under varying pH and solution compositions.

The use of DMF is one of the major drawbacks for the transfer of UiO-66 to large-scale applications, since DMF is an expensive and toxic organic solvent. In this work, we propose a water-based route to synthesise UiO-66 using either dimethylterephthalate or bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate, which can be obtained from chemical recycling of waste polyethyleneterephthalate, as a source of the linker. Hydrochloric acid and acetic acid were used as modulators during the synthesis to control the kinetics of ester hydrolysis and MOF crystallisation, aiming to avoid collateral precipitation of terephthalic acid. A chemometric design of experiments was employed to optimise the reaction parameters, finding that 15 molar equivalents of hydrochloric acid enable hydrolysis without inhibiting crystallisation, while acetic acid controls which phase is obtained, favouring the desired face centred cubic topology at 15 molar equivalents. The optimised conditions afford UiO-66 with high crystallinity and porosity in just 2 hours at 90 \u00b0C. A crucial role in the process is played by the monoester, which is more soluble than both the diester and the diacid in the reaction environment and is presumed to be involved in the formation of secondary building units. We also developed a DMF-free workup protocol based on the use of ethanol/dimethylsulfoxide mixtures and water. 50-fold scale up (500 mL) was demonstrated using a round bottom flask, producing UiO-66 with properties comparable to the product of the small-scale synthesis and with a space-time yield > 200 kg/(m3d).", "date": "2025-08-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we present guanidinylated chitin nanocrystals (GCNCs) that are dispersible at neutral pH. GCNCs were synthesized by guanidinylating partially deacetylated chitin nanocrystals (CNCs) using 1-amidinopyrazole hydrochloride. The degrees of guanidinylation and acetylation of the GCNCs were 4.6% and 75.7%, respectively. A 1.0% GCNC dispersion was prepared in 0.5% acetic acid and subjected to sonication. Although slight white turbidity from light scattering was observed, no visible macroscopic precipitates were detected. Dynamic light scattering analysis indicated that the average GCNC diameter was 327.2 nm. Upon neutralization with 0.1 M NaOH, the GCNC dispersion reduced transmittance due to aggregation. Nonetheless, the dispersion remained more stable than that of CNCs, suggesting that the guanidino group\u2019s strong basicity and positive charge helped mitigate aggregation. Interestingly, GCNCs also dispersed uniformly in 0.1 M HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) up to 0.5% after sonication, although the average diameter increased to 1115.1 nm, 3.4 times greater than at pH 3.0. In contrast, guanidinylated chitin nanofibers did not exhibit the same dispersibility despite the presence of guanidino groups. This result indicates that guanidinylation enhances the dispersion of low-aspect-ratio nanochitins such as CNCs.

These SVC effects are often crucial for describing spin-forbidden or spin-flip processes, such as intersystem crossing (ISC), reverse ISC (RISC), and phosphorescence.   Previously, these derivatives could only be obtained through numerical differentiation. With our new implementation, they can now be computed based on analytical formulas, underpinning a significant advance toward more accurate and efficient dynamics simulations of spin-forbidden processes where SVC effects are vital.   Although developing the analytical nuclear derivative method is challenging, our implementation achieves substantial efficiency gains over numerical approaches, yielding up to a 36-fold speedup in benchmark tests.

This task involves identifying the mechanism of the process, that can take place either adiabatically or nonadiabatically, and calculating the necessary quantities, such as vibronic couplings, according to the mechanism. Due to different electronic configurations involved, it almost becomes inevitable to use wavefunction-based multireference methods. However, the accurate prediction of rate constants for large molecular systems is limited by the high computational cost of common choices such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF). Since PCET reactions occur in a wide range of biological processes, the development of alternatives with large scalability is of particular interest. A promising alternative is the multistate density-functional theory method based on absolutely-localized molecular orbitals (ALMOs). This gives access to the diabatic donor and acceptor states, adiabatic ground and first excited states, and the electronic coupling. In this work, different operators for the construction of ALMOs are considered. A comparison with CASSCF and N-electron valence state second-order perturbation theory shows that accurate vibronic couplings can be obtained using a non-Hermitian operator. As the method relies on a fragmentation of the system, spectator fragments can be explicitly included with a convenient computational cost.

The exothermic formation of carbamate and bicarbonate drives sorbent dissolution, effectively storing energy that is later recovered through crystallization to power CO\u2082 desorption. This reversible energy-coupling mechanism allows air-captured CO\u2082 to be enriched to >95% purity and fed directly into an electrochemical reactor. Using tailored electrocatalysts, the system converts CO\u2082 to CO or formate with up to 99% Faradaic efficiency; the resulting CO stream reaches 82% purity, suitable for direct ignition.

Here, >80% sequence coverage of Lc and Fd antibody subunits was achieved following the aggregation of multiple fragmentation methods in middle-down experiments. Proteoform Studio was also used to define mass targets for subunits generated from above-hinge digestion and disulfide bond reduction of the NIST monoclonal antibody standard. Fragmentation analysis settings for signal to noise and isotope fit score were adjusted to achieve consistency with manually validated results. Analysis in Proteoform Studio facilitated data-guided adjustments of targeted method settings, resulting in higher sequence coverage for NIST subunits spiked into a simple antibody mixture. Software and fragmentation settings from these initial analyses informed definition of a targeted workflow to analyze NIST subunits spiked into a more complex plasma immunoglobulin G background.

However, their limited structural variety makes it challenging to tailor their lubrication properties for specific applications. This study demonstrated the potential of two-dimensional silver thiolate (AgSR) coordination polymers, which feature distinctive organic\u2013inorganic lamellar crystal structures, as tunable solid lubricants based on the precise structural design. X-ray diffraction measurements showed that various AgSR compounds with linear alkylthiolato and para-substituted benzenethiolato ligands formed layered structures with high crystallinity. Ball-on-plate friction tests were performed on powder-supported specimens to assess the solid lubricating properties of AgSR. The AgSR-supported specimens with alkylthiolato ligands demonstrated a coefficient of friction (COF) of approximately 0.1, considerably lower than that of the well-known layered materials, MoS2 and alkylammonium-intercalated mica. This exceptional lubricity of AgSR is likely attributed to their unique interlayer structures, which exhibit minimal interdigitation of alkyl chains. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses of the worn surfaces of the AgSR-supported specimens revealed that AgSR compounds create lubricating films on the sliding substrates. Furthermore, for a series of AgSR compounds featuring para-substituted benzenethiolato ligands, the COF values were highly affected by the functional groups at the para position, which affected their interlayer interactions. Strong interlayer interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, resulted in considerable increases in the COF to approximately 0.7, suggesting that the lubrication properties of AgSR are derived from the ease of cleavage in their layered crystal structures. These findings imply that AgSR offers considerable advantages over traditional inorganic layered materials for the tailored development of custom solid lubricants.", "date": "2025-08-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Polymer Science; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

It could lead to erosion of surface and subsurface equipment, well plugging from sand grain deposition and accumulation, and potential collapse of sections in horizontal wells, resulting in non-productive time, costly cleanup, and remedial or work-over operations. Various researchers have proposed strategies and models to tackle sand production and its associated problems. While these models have successfully predicted the onset of sand production, cavity stability, and rock collapse, they often struggle to accurately forecast the sand production rate due to the complexity of influencing parameters and the difficulty in fully capturing all reservoir and wellbore processes. Early prediction of sand production before drilling and field development is critical for selecting appropriate equipment and mitigation strategies. A thorough evaluation of sanding potential based on key reservoir and wellbore properties is essential to inform field development plans. In this study, a \u03bd-support vector classification (\u03bd-SVC) model was used to classify sanding potential, achieving 100% accuracy on the training set and 87% on the test set. For wells identified as having sanding potential, the sand occurrence was predicted using critical drawdown pressure estimated by a Random Forest model, also with 97.65% training and 88.89% test accuracy. The expected volume of sand produced over time was then predicted using an AdaBoost regression model with 99.51% training and 79.07% test accuracy. Together, these models form a predictive pipeline for proactive sand control and management. Their effectiveness was validated using publicly available field data, demonstrating strong predictive capability for real world applications. The results indicate that these machine learning models can support completion engineers in designing timely and effective sand management strategies, minimizing production losses and operational risks.

In situ electron paramagnetic spin resonance (EPR) spectroscopy confirms the presence of pre-existing polarons, which undergo oxidation to bipolarons during charging and revert during discharge, establishing a direct link between spin dynamics and charge storage. Electrochemical analysis, including cyclic voltammetry, Trasatti, and Dunn methods, reveals that up to 83% of the total capacitance originates from faradaic contributions, which can be attributed to sulfur-doped carbon. Comparison with mesoporous onion-like carbon (OLC), whose capacitance arises from a purely electric double-layer (EDL), further supports this conclusion.

Herein, we report on the development of methodology in which the resource- and waste-intensity of nucleophilic substitution reactions can be drastically reduced.

Its oxidation reaction is a key half-cell process in both electrochemical reforming for hydrogen and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). Traditionally, methanol oxidation on Pt catalysts is understood to proceed via dual pathways: an indirect route involving *CO intermediates and a direct route producing soluble species such as formaldehyde and formate. However, our 18O isotope labeling experiments with H218O and CH318OH have, for the first time, revealed that a majority proportion of methanol-derived oxygen does not appear in the final products, especially under alkaline conditions. To resolve this discrepancy, we propose a revolutionized pathway featuring the *O*OCHOH intermediate and the C\u2013O bond dissociation of methanol. This mechanism, supported by control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, coexists with the conventional indirect pathway and explains the observed high C\u2013O bond cleavage ratios (~65% in acid and >75% in base). Moreover, mechanistic studies show that increasing hydroxide concentration enhances the oxidation state of Pt, modulating the reaction pathway and affecting the Faradaic efficiencies of CO2/CO32\u2212 and HCOOH /HCOO\u2212 products.

To this end, we present a system for performing photocatalytic reactions that combines time-resolved in situ measurements with a fully automated process for liquid handling, light source control, dynamic feedback and automated kinetic data evaluation, enabled by an open-source Python framework. The system is applied to study photocatalytic water oxidation using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as both photosensitizer and water oxidation catalyst, with oxygen formation being measured in situ. Using this benchmark reaction, we investigate the effect of different reaction parameters (catalyst and sacrificial oxidant concentration, irradiance, pH-value) on the rate of oxygen evolution. The results show that the automated process enables highly reproducible experiments while obtaining full time-concentration curves with a high temporal resolution (seconds) for each experiment.

We report a laccase-catalyzed, tyrosine residue-selective biorthogonal reaction with sugar-conjugated 1-methylurazoles, enabling tyrosine-C-selective pseudo-glycosylation at Tyr10 of amyloid \u03b21-40 (A\u03b240) and at TyrA14 of human insulin.

Pseudo-glycosylated insulin displayed increased aggregation resistance without loss of bioactivity. Our findings underscore that protein aggregability can be controlled by targeting residues involved in strong intermolecular interactions as well as increasing hydration without strictly mimicking natural posttranslational modification.

Owning to the molecular nature of SMMs, supramolecular interactions are usually perceived as weak and negligible in shaping their magnetic hysteresis loop. Here, we designed a series of compounds to show that supramolecular interactions instead play a key role in governing the hysteresis loop of SMMs via controlling the efficiency of Raman relaxation. We chose the D5h symmetric or pentagonal-bipyramidal (PB) family of Dy(III) SMMs which has a cationic complex with the common formulae of [Dy(L)2(py)5]+ and a fixed anion of [BPh4]-. Here we vary only the peripheral parts of the axial L ligands with disparate strength of supramolecular interactions.

Custom axisymmetric tanks are used to study the different flow regimes that emerge during battery cycling at various flow rates. A dual online diagnostic tool based on UV-vis spectroscopy enables precise tracking of the state of charge (SoC) of both electrolytes. The experimental campaign is supported by a mathematical model that implements accurate empirical fits for the density and viscosity obtained in previous work, which qualitatively reproduces the observed behavior. The results show that at high flow rates, momentum-dominated flows induce strong mixing in both tanks, yielding homogeneously mixed electrolytes. As the flow rate decreases, buoyancy effects start to play a role, and each electrolyte exhibits different flow regimes as a result of different SoC-dependent density changes. During charge, the positive tank exhibits a submerged jet that crosses the tank directly to the outlet, causing a decrease in capacity. In contrast, the negative tank shows a stratified piston flow that becomes more prevalent as the jet momentum decreases. During discharge, the negolyte flows directly to the outlet, causing a marked capacity drop, while the positive tank maintains relatively well-mixed conditions.

Herein, we propose that strong electric fields can also arise from the dipole alignment of organic molecules perpendicular to the air\u2013water interface. Full-spectral confocal fluorescence microsco-py images show that the voltage-sensitive fluorophore, 4-Di-1-ASP, aligns its dipole perpendicu-lar to the air\u2013water interface and exhibits an 18 nm shift in emission.

In contrast, a molecule-by-molecule elucidation of the full MMD would yield an extremely informative new perspective on macromolecule diversity, while eliminating the limitations and time commitment associated with fractionation.

Innovative approaches coupling antibody recognition with signal amplification mechanisms are therefore highly desirable. The CRISPR-Cas13 system, known for its powerful collateral cleavage activity, has emerged as a leading diagnostic tool for ultrasensitive detection of nucleic acid targets.

Poly(p-dioxanone) (PPDO) is a high-performance, closed-loop recyclable polymer; however, its widespread application is hindered by the challenges associated with the large-scale synthesis of its monomer, p-dioxanone (pDO). In this work, we present a one-pot, direct synthesis of pDO from the commodity chemicals-methyl glycolate (MG) and ethylene oxide (EO). We identify iron chloride (FeCl3) as the most effective catalyst for the tandem ring-opening reaction (ROR) between MG and EO, yielding methyl 2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)acetate (MHEA) as an intermediate, which undergoes self-cyclization to form pDO in a one-pot process. Systematic optimization studies show that the optimal ROR occurs at 0 \u00b0C for 1 hour, followed by a two-stage MHEA cyclization (1 hour at 100 \u00b0C and vacuum distillation at 100 \u00b0C), resulting in a maximum isolated pDO yield of 66%. The purified pDO monomer is a white crystalline solid that is readily polymerizable to high-molecular-weight PPDO. This efficient, green, and atom-economical strategy offers a promising approach for the sustainable and industrial-scale production of pDO, thereby advancing the potential for large-scale applications of PPDO and contributing to the development of a circular plastic economy.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Polymerization (Polymers)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Furthermore, the corresponding Pd0 complex is capable of cleaving C\u2013X bonds in alkyl halides upon photoexcitation with visible light, forming the respective PdI halide species. This provides definitive experimental evidence for this elementary step, nearly thirty years after the original proposal by Suzuki and Miyaura.

Key molecular characteristics, such as molecular weight, LogP, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, topological polar surface area (TPSA), fraction of sp\u00b3-hybridized carbons (Fsp\u00b3), and rotatable bonds, were calculated for each molecule via the RDKit in Python. Five out of nine compounds met both filters when drug likeness was evaluated via Lipinski's rule of five and Veber's rule; macrocyclic and high-molecular-weight antibiotics, such as dactinomycin and rapamycin, failed because their size and polarity thresholds were exceeded. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used on scaled descriptor data to investigate the distribution of these chemicals in chemical space. The results were separated according to molecular weight and polarity. Furthermore, pairwise Tanimoto similarity computations were performed after extended connectivity fingerprints were generated to evaluate structural similarity. A hierarchical dendrogram and clustered heatmap were used to illustrate these compounds, revealing their notable structural differences. The observed PCA-based clustering was supported by additional dimensionality reduction via t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), which captured nonlinear interactions in chemical space.

Through the concerted action of selective Watson-Crick base pairing between the sticky ends and bivalent antibody-antigen binding, such antigen-conjugated nanostars phase-separate to form micron-scale hybrid condensates whose structural stability is provided by both nucleic acids and antibodies.

Recognizing this critical role in model performance, various decoy selection strategies were analyzed to enhance machine learning models based on the Protein per Atom Score Contributions Derived Interaction Fingerprint (PADIF). We explored three distinct workflows for decoy selection: (1) random selection from extensive databases like ZINC15, (2) leveraging recurrent non-binders from highthroughput screening (HTS) assays stored as dark chemical matter, and (3) data augmentation by utilizing diverse conformations from docking results. Active molecules from ChEMBL, combined with these decoy approaches, were used to train and test different machine learning models based on PADIF. The final validation was done by confirming experimentally determined inactive compounds from the LIT-PCBA dataset. Our findings reveal that models trained with random selections from ZINC15 and compounds from dark chemical matter closely mimic the performance of those trained with actual non-binders, presenting viable alternatives for creating accurate models in the absence of specific inactivity data. Furthermore, all models showed an enhanced ability to explore new chemical spaces for their specific target and enhanced the top active compound selection over classical scoring functions, thereby boosting the screening power in molecular docking.

The motions experienced by individual atoms in the protein can be precisely quantified through NMR relaxation rates, but their measurement requires well-resolved spectral responses. Two-dimensional 1H 15N correlation spectra are the standard approach to resolve amide signals in protein NMR, but come with an excessive cost in experimental time when spectra are heavily congested due to limited 15N chemical shift dispersions. This limitation often thwarts complete characterization of dynamics for intrinsically disordered proteins, especially when they feature low-complexity or homopolymer amino acid sequences.

Recently, gallium has been identified as a promoter which enables dispersion of transition metal sites, raising their activity and selectivity. However, quantitative information on alloying dynamics under reaction conditions are not readily available and a gen-eral computational method to access such information is lacking. Here, an ab initio molecular dynamics workflow with enhanced sampling methods is used to probe the alloying behavior of Ni-, Pd-, and Pt-Ga nanoparticles under operating conditions (T = 600\u00b0C) in presence of H2 or CO. The three metals display different alloying behaviors with Ga: Ni forms a core surrounded by gallium, while Pd and Pt form different alloyed structures. Both H2 and CO shift the alloying state to different extents. A set of three descriptors is then proposed to compare and quantify the alloying behavior of these catalyst models: (i) the position \u03b1min of the most stable alloying state; (ii) the curvature \u03b7\u03b1 of the free energy at \u03b1min, re-ferred to as the alloying hardness; (iii) the skew \u03ba\u03b1 of the free energy at \u03b1min, which relates to its propensity to alloy or segregate. The cost of alloy reorganization, which correlates with alloy hardness, is a major part of the free energy barri-ers of propane dehydrogenation.

However, a major issue in the use of quinones for ECCS is reactivity with O2 in the reduced state. Unfortunately, quinones are also known to suffer from a trade-off between their redox-potential and strength of binding to CO2, such that in general, quinones which do not react with O2 do not react strongly enough with CO2 to be of use. In this work, computational methods are used to explore how the carbonyl positioning, as well as the ring structure, of quinones affects the associated trade-offs. Using a model based on H\u00fcckel theory we show that the redox-potential of quinones strongly depends on the change in aromaticity upon reduction. It is then shown that by changing the quinone ring structure, it is possible to tune the redox potential by approximately 0.8 V. Finally, one new type of quinone, 2,3-naphthoquinone, is predicted to be a particularly promising candidate for ECCS, and NMR spectroscopy is utilised to demonstrate it capturing CO2 in the dianion state.

Here, we present an uncontracted multireference perturbation theory based on the FCIQMC imaginary-time evolution of effective Hamiltonians, built upon the generalized active space concept and L\u00f6wdin\u2019s partitioning technique.

Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, this study resolved the concomitant state-of-charge (SOC) dependent change of the ionic pore resistance (R_Ion ) of graphite electrodes via measurements conducted at low temperatures and stack pressures of 0.2 and 1.0 MPa. The pressure-dependent results reveal an increase of R_Ion upon complete lithiation of up to ~32% and ~45% at the lower and higher pressure, respectively. This data was combined with literature data on the volumetric expansion of graphite particles obtained from X-ray diffraction measurements to reveal a significant decrease in porosity upon lithiation.

Despite being the workhorse of polymer industry and despite the years of extensive research, the improvement of Ziegler-Natta catalysts has been mostly empirical. In particular, the coordination surrounding of Ti sites in pre-catalysts, key for the formation of active sites upon AlEt3 activation, has been highly debated. In this work we prepared a series of pre-catalysts by increasing the concentration of BCl3 modifier in the synthesis, known to affect the amount of Cl- and alkoxo-ligands in the Ti local surrounding as well as the activity in ethylene polymerization. We develop a methodology, relying on a library of theoretical XAS spectra for DFT-optimized structural models and benchmarked on a series of well-defined molecular compounds. Quantitative analysis of XAS data allows us to evaluate the relative fractions of Ti sites in fully Cl-surrounding as well as containing alkoxide and O-donor ligands. The analysis shows that the number of Ti-O bonds (initially mostly present in alkoxo-form) decreases upon treatment with BCl3 up to B/Ti ratio of 2, coherent with earlier proposals, and increases afterwards, due to O-donor ligands, likely related to B-alkoxo species coordinated to Ti. The catalytic activity of these pre-catalysts after activation with AlEt3 in ethylene polymerization passes through the maximum at B/Ti ratio of ~2, pointing to its relation to the detrimental effect of O-based ligands on the activity. Thus, the approach developed allows to address and quantify the metal speciation in such complex systems as Ziegler-Natta pre-catalysts and relate this to their catalytic activity, a first step towards establishing quantitative structure-activity relationships.", "date": "2025-08-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Surface", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we present AIMNet2-NSE (Neural Spin-charge Equilibration), a neural network potential that incorporates spin-charge equilibration for accurate treatment of molecules and reactions with arbitrary charge and spin multiplicities.

Within the GBM microenvironment, tumor-educated microglia and astrocytes adopt immunosuppressive M2-like and A2 phenotypes, respectively, which shield GBM cells from adaptive immune attack. In this review, we examine emerging adjuvant strategies designed to molecularly reprogram glial cells toward proinflammatory M1/A1 states, amplifying antitumor immunity. First, we summarize key aspects of GBM pathobiology and identify why conventional treatments fail to achieve durable control. Next, we dissect the signaling networks that govern glial phase states, including NF-\u03baB, STAT3, IRF3, NLRP3, and cGAS\u2013STING axes. We then provide a mechanism-centric analysis of pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) agonists, inflammasome modulators, and cyclic-dinucleotide STING agonists, integrating quantitative preclinical data with early clinical trial results. For each adjuvant, we distinguish between direct astrocytic engagement and indirect cytokine-mediated reprogramming. Modulation of glial phase states holds considerable promise for enhancing personalized vaccine efficacy and for converting immunologically \u201ccold\u201d GBM into a T cell\u2013inflamed tumor. Consequently, targeting glial cell phase modulation is a highly attractive strategy for GBM immunotherapy, with the potential to maximize therapeutic benefit.\nDespite increasing interest in cancer immunotherapy, GBM remains one of the most challenging malignancies to treat due to its uniquely immunosuppressive brain microenvironment. While chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized treatment of GBM, these strategies have had limited success largely due to failure to control immunological memory and the dominant role of glial cells in immune evasion. Astrocytes and microglia in the GBM microenvironment undergo tumor-induced polarization toward immunosuppressive phenotypes, forming a barrier to effective T cell\u2013mediated antitumor responses. Recent studies suggest that molecularly reprogramming glial cells toward proinflammatory states could recondition the tumor microenvironment (TME), enabling more effective immunotherapy.

The S-to-Pb2+ coordination within the [PbSBrn]2-n was probed by UV-vis and solvent phase 207Pb NMR, both which showed considerable coordination between [PbSBrn]2-n and the -rich BE and DPE, whose reactivity affected CsPbBr3 growth. The effect was more pronounced for CsPbBr3 prepared via RT, where morphology was tunable, with -rich solvents producing thin rod-like CsPbBr3 with blue emission, compared to the green emitting thicker platelets formed via HI. While XRD showed crystalline products for both RT and HI, with orthorhombic and cubic forms respectively, the RT products had considerable surface defects, as was indicated by lower quantum yields and fast photoluminescence decay times of only a few nanoseconds.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Herein, we report a theoretical study on the unprotected nitrenoid C(sp3)\u2212H insertion using three iron-porphyrin complexes with distinct axial coordination environments. Our study reveals the formation of two reactive nitrenoid intermediates, [FeNH2]+ and [FeNH], and elucidates their divergent mechanistic pathways and reactivity profiles.

Furthermore, we developed a multivariate linear regression (MLR) model for the hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) step, identifying key factors governing reaction activity. Our study uncovers the critical role of axial ligands in modulating the stability and reactivity of iron-nitrenoid species, thereby steering the preferred reaction pathway in iron porphyrin-catalyzed C(sp3)\u2212H amination. In addition, QM/MM calculations on the P411APA system unveil that the [FeNH2]\u207a pathway is more favorable, supporting its role as the active aminating species in the enzymatic nitrenoid C(sp3)\u2212H insertion reactions.

Previous computational research has focussed on evaluating the compositional  dependence of NP binding and translocation to  'model' lipid  membranes, i.e. membranes that are in equilibrium, flat, fluid and  composed of a few lipid species.  The observation of strong local variation of curvature and phase along  many membranes in biology, however, suggests that these features are important  for membrane-related processes. In particular, the thermodynamic factors underlying curvature formation and phase separation appear to be essential for  regulating intricate membrane functions such as insertion and dispersion in a precise and  controllable manner. In this study, we have employed  coarse-grained simulation to shed light on the role of curvature and phase on the  adsorption and dispersion of a typical hydrophobic NPs like nano-C60 (or n-C60), for a setup that mimics a lung membrane at biologically relevant scales. The effect of curvature on n-C60 uptake, which is particularly striking when the membrane is in the gel phase,  is explained in terms of lipid defects, and we find that uptake modulates the fluidity and defect  characteristics of the resulting membrane in a state-dependent fashion, and  will affect protein binding.

One fluidic approach involves creating extensional flow using constrictions. Transient relaxation of deformed droplets is then measured at the constriction exit.  We propose an alternative, arguably simpler approach: we use steady deformation within a constriction to measure surface tension. We calculate surface tension using Taylor's small deformation theory, which describes the relationship between droplet deformation and the Capillary number, or ratio of applied viscous stress to restoring surface tension stress.  Taylor originally developed his theory for unconfined droplets in pure shear or pure extension.  We apply Taylor\u2019s theory to droplets in pressure driven flows. We generate and flow emulsion droplets through a series of increasingly narrow constrictions and use steady deformation to measure surface tension.  We investigate both water-in-oil and oil-in-water droplets, stabilized by three different surfactants over a range of concentrations.  In a subset of experiments, we vary the viscosity ratio by adding polyethylene glycol diacrylate to water droplets. Validation using both the transient deformation fluidic approach and pendant drop measurements on individual droplets demonstrates the viability of Taylor\u2019s theory in regimes beyond those originally proposed.  Importantly, our results suggest steady state deformation in pressure driven flows can be used to measure surface tension even when droplets are slightly confined.

By coupling the QM and MM regions through the instantaneous MM electrostatic polarization response to QM charge density fluctuations, DREEM enables consistent treatment of ground and excited electronic states, capturing electronic state-specific polarization and dispersion effects absent in conventional mean-field or linear response approaches. The use of electrostatic potential fitting (ESPF) approximation method to describe charge density fluctuations significantly improves the computational efficiency compared the integral-exact direct reaction field. In this work, we present two methodological advancements to extend the applicability of DREEM to realistic condensed-phase simulations. Firstly the development of efficient analytic energy gradients, enabling geometry optimization, transition state searches, and molecular dynamics, and secondly a formulation of periodic boundary conditions (PBC) compatible with the DREEM framework. These capabilities are implemented in the open-source OpenESPF code, interfacing PySCF and OpenMM for high-performance QM and MM calculations. We demonstrate that the resulting implementation enables practical simulations of excited-state optical properties in periodic polarizable environments, where we calculate the fluorescence spectrum of acetone in water including quantum vibronic and non-Condon effects. This paves the way for predictive modeling of photochemical reactivity and spectroscopy in complex systems where environment polarization is important.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The incorporation of the amyloid-targeting fragments successfully produced compounds with affinity for A\u03b242 aggregates and that stain amyloid plaques in the brains of 5xFAD mice.

All-atom (AA) simulations provide fine resolution, but are computationally infeasible for large systems over longer durations. Coarse-grained (CG) and ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) models have a lower resolution and computational cost while still being able to conserve essential protein features. Prior work on a Multiscale Machine-learned Modeling Infrastructure (MuMMI) combined both AA and CG simulations to study RAS-RAF protein interactions, leveraging CG models for longer timescales and using AA to investigate unusual conformations in greater detail. However, MuMMI is still resource-intensive, and this study aims to maximize exploration of the protein conformational space while reducing computational cost. In this paper, we build on prior work that integrates UCG models based on heterogeneous elastic network modeling (hENM) into the MuMMI workflow. We demonstrate that UCG models enable accurate sampling of protein conformations, focusing on simulating RAS-RAF protein interactions. Using higher-resolution CG Martini simulation data, we can automatically refine intramolecular interactions in UCG models. We present a scalable Python package that uses fluctuations observed in higher-resolution CG Martini simulations to estimate bond coefficients of the UCG model. We built novel machine learning-based backmapping methods to recover more detailed CG Martini structures from UCG structures, using diffusion models to learn the mapping between scales. Finally, we present UCG-mini-MuMMI, an accessible and less compute-intensive version of MuMMI as a resource for the scientific community.

Although structurally distinct, all three drugs interact with ergosterol in the fungal plasma membrane to form assemblies that disrupt membrane integrity and function. To investigate how polyene structure influences intracellular distribution and its potential association with resistance, we developed a comprehensive set of fluorescent probes derived from each clinically used polyene. Each probe features the same fluorophore conjugated to a conserved functional group, preserving the amphoteric nature of the parent drugs and enabling live-cell imaging. This unified design allowed direct comparison of subcellular localization and trafficking across Candida species, including sterol biosynthesis mutants with high-level polyene resistance. The probes maintained ergosterol-dependent antifungal activity in vitro and revealed structure-specific subcellular distribution patterns. In highly resistant strains, all three probes showed enhanced accumulation within the vacuole lumen. These findings suggest that vacuolar sequestration contributes to polyene resistance and may reflect a previously unrecognized aspect of the fungal stress response to polyenes.  More broadly, this work provides the first direct visual evidence that polyene structure influences intracellular fate and membrane trafficking in fungal cells.

We selected 115 problems from NMR-Challenge.com, which has been used by students practicing NMR structure elucidation, collecting >1 million human responses, and developed a plain text problem format for evaluating LLM reasoning in this domain. We evaluated 7 LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, o1, o1-mini, o3-mini, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini-2.0-Flash), comparing 5 prompts to spur chain-of-thought reasoning in different ways, especially comparing the influence of providing background NMR chemistry knowledge, reasoning strategy, or both. Newer models trained to emphasize reasoning performed better, and increasing reasoning effort led to modest improvements, but prompting and varying temperature didn't have an effect. We also evaluated undergraduate organic chemistry students in a controlled setting, and analyzed answer submission statistics from global submissions to NMR-Challenge.com, to characterize human performance on these problems. The top-performing students surpassed smaller models like GPT-4o by 24%, 33%, and 29% on the Easy, Moderate, and Hard sets.

Our modeling reveals that XCD is capable of distinguishing dichroic contributions arising from both a local chiral center and global molecular twist, revealing their intricate interplay and potential for constructive or destructive interference. We show that sterically-induced global distortions can dominate the XCD signal in some cases, even suppressing the response from the chiral center itself.

Inspired by our previous work on the Newman Kwart Rearrangement (NKR), a high barrier (35-43 kcal/mol) C\u2013S bond forming reaction, we sought to leverage photothermal conversion for challenging C\u2013N bond forming SNAr reactions. In this work, we demonstrate that incorporation of an inexpensive photothermal agent, carbon black, and irradiation with red light affords several lightly activated, intermolecular substitution reactions. Attempts to apply this approach to electron neutral and electron rich aryl halides resulted in unproductive reactivity, leading us to examine the reaction barriers. Computations revealed elevated barriers which were within the range previously achieved during our photothermally mediated NKR. Electron neutral, intramolecular analogs were synthesized and found to undergo productive reactivity in short time frames (3-20 minutes), indicating that the inhomogeneous nature of the photothermal heating was a challenge in terms of colocalizing two reactants sufficiently close to the nanoparticle surface. This concept was further leveraged into a one pot, two step SNAr, where an initial intermolecular reaction occurs at a lower barrier, which then primes the substrate for a second, intramolecular substitution.

The salt is hypothesized to influence HA chain conformation and HA-HA interactions mainly through the Hofmeister effect and electrostatic interactions, thereby affecting HA degree of modification (DoM), degree of crosslinking (DoCr), and chain arrangement within the hydrogel network. These changes become fixed upon crosslinking, resulting in stable modifications persisting after salt removal. To verify this, HA solutions (5% w/v) were crosslinked with 1,4-butanediol diglycidal ether (BDDE) after adding a sodium salt from the Hofmeister series (sodium citrate, sodium sulfate, or sodium chloride; 0-0.67 M). Following crosslinking and salt removal, the hydrogels were characterized using NMR, swelling, rheological, and degradation tests. Results demonstrated that salt treatment influenced swelling ratio, mechanical properties, and degradation rates, with changes depending on salt type and concentration. NMR analysis confirmed that salts did not directly participate in crosslinking but affected DoM and DoCr. Changes in hydrogel properties were primarily driven by DoM alterations, with potential contributions from non-covalent interactions and modified HA chain arrangement. This salt treatment technique may enable designing hydrogels with unique properties not achievable by simple changes in crosslinker concentration.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of augmenting high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNPs) with both electrostatic and dispersion corrections on the prediction of gas-phase intermolecular interactions between small organic molecules. We employ a machine learning-based charge equilibration (QEq) scheme to model electrostatics and the Machine-Learning eXchange-hole Dipole Moment (MLXDM) model to account for dispersion.

Equilibrating polymer systems is a challenging endeavor, particularly as relaxation times often exceed timescales accessible by atomistic molecular dynamics. The use of coarse-grained (CG) models followed by backmapping can mitigate such issues but typically requires substantial technical effort to obtain  chemistry-specific CG models. By contrast, GAMERS equilibrates phenomenological models, establishes system-specific mappings via a polymer-physics oriented isomorphism, and then guides atomistic segments to target positions with time-dependent biasing forces. We demonstrate GAMERS by using Kremer-Grest models to equilibrate four chemically distinct polymers: polyethylene oxide, cis-polybutadiene, bisphenol-A-polycarbonate, and atactic polystyrene. The method rapidly converges to correct densities and reproduces expected chain statistics at and above the Kuhn length. Comparison of mechanical properties across initialization strategies reveals substantial differences in tensile response, underscoring the importance of proper equilibration.

We introduce the Molecular Equivariant Transformer (MET), a symmetry-aware pretraining framework that leverages quantum-derived atomic charge distributions to guide molecular representation learning. MET combines an Equivariant Graph Neural Network (EGNN) with a Transformer architecture to extract physically meaningful features from three-dimensional molecular geometries. Unlike previous models that rely purely on structural inputs or handcrafted descriptors, MET is pretrained to predict atomic partial charges, which are quantities grounded in quantum chemistry. This enables MET to capture essential electronic information without requiring downstream labels. We show that this pretraining scheme improves performance across diverse molecular property prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. Analyses of the learned representations reveal chemically interpretable structure\u2013property relationships, including the emergence of functional group patterns and smooth alignment with molecular dipoles. Ablation studies confirm that the EGNN encoder plays a crucial role in capturing transferable spatial features, while the Transformer layers adapt these features to specific prediction tasks. This architecture draws direct analogies to quantum mechanical basis transformations, where MET learns to transition from coordinate-based to electron-based representations in a symmetry-preserving manner. By integrating domain knowledge with modern deep learning techniques, MET offers a unified and interpretable framework for data-efficient molecular modeling, with broad applications in computational chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science.

Increasing the molar ratio of sodium oleate to oleic acid promotes facet-selective passivation along {111} facets, leading to progressive truncation of tetrahedra and yielding morphologies ranging from truncated tetrahedra to extremely truncated rod-like shapes. Our electron microscopy studies show that the synthesis of tetrahedron-shaped nanoparticles does not require a symmetry-breaking transformation from octahedra, as the initial crystallite formed is tetrahedra. When sodium oleate is removed from the synthesis, thermodynamically-driven monodisperse octahedral nanoparticles are formed. We find that ligand composition also influences the doping of ions into the crystal structure, with higher sodium oleate concentrations reducing Zn2+ incorporation due to modified metal-ligand coordination. Tetrahedral nanoparticles synthesized under optimal conditions exhibit higher room temperature saturation magnetization than bulk-like magnetite, highlighting their potential for magnetic nanoparticle-based biosensing applications.

Upon heating from the glass, we observe a series of three sharp thermal events at ca. 380, 430, and 500 K associated with hitherto unknown polymorphs of this carbon-based solid.  The single-crystal diffraction data provide a framework to understand this rich phenomenology in terms of the activation of well-defined molecular rotations that increase the occupancy of interstitial sites and trigger a sharp decrease in density near the observed glass-transition temperature.

The efficiencies and rates of their excited state deactivation pathways, strongly modulated by the environment, were unveiled through advanced time resolved spectroscopies with nanosecond and femtosecond temporal resolution. Highly efficient fluorescence and intersystem crossing were found to occur in non polar solvents, which justify all the absorbed quanta. Emission measurements in a non polar rigid matrix at low temperature uncovered small singlet-to-triplet energy gaps for these molecules. Indeed, in fairly polar media, an intramolecular charge transfer state quasi-isoenergetic to the triplet excited state was stabilized and populated, resulting in reverse intersystem crossing followed by orange/red delayed fluorescence. Similarly, delayed fluorescence was clearly detected in thin films of TRZ1-3 at room temperature. Upon increasing the degree of branching among the molecules in this series, the emission color in the solid state was turned from orange to deep red and the amplitude of the delayed component was largely enhanced. The mechanistic reason underlying this behavior could be found in the relatively faster intersystem crossing than prompt fluorescence in the multi-branched compounds. Our results demonstrate the positive role played by the degree of branching in boosting red delayed fluorescence in all-organic materials for applications in third generation organic light emitting diodes.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Using laser-induced projectile impact testing (LIPIT) and nanoindentation, we evaluated polyurethane-based inverse opals fabricated with periodically ordered air pores (with diameters of 370 nm and 510 nm) to investigate their strain-dependent optical responses under both dynamic and quasi-static loading conditions.

These deformations produced characteristic photonic bandgap shifts and color changes in the Lab color space, which are visualized using colorimetric profiles. The colorimetric profiles reveal micron-scale deformation patterns and strain gradients across impact craters. In contrast to conventional mechanochromic systems that rely on bond rupture or molecular changes, the polymeric inverse opals respond through immediate, reversible photonic bandgap shifts caused by structural deformation.

Its natural occurrence in fungi, plants, bacteria, and insects, along with its applicability in bioremediation, wastewater treatment, organic synthesis, and various industrial processes, makes it a valuable biocatalyst. However, laccase's stability and activity are often compromised under industrial conditions such as high temperature, variable pH, and the presence of inhibitors. Recent advancements have explored enzyme engineering, immobilization, and solvent engineering to address these limitations, but these methods often involve complex, costly, or unsustainable procedures. In this search, deep eutectic solvents (DESs), have emerged as a promising green solvents to enhance laccase performance. Studies indicate that polyol-based DESs significantly improve both the activity and thermal stability of laccase. Despite this, the specific influence of polyol structure particularly the number and position of hydroxyl groups remains unclear. This study investigates 15 betaine- and choline chloride-based DESs containing three different diols to elucidate their effect on laccase activity and stability. The findings indicate that only betaine-derived diol-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) enhance both the activity and stability of laccase. In particular, DESs with a 1:4 molar ratio significantly improves laccase activity. Among them, Bet:1,2-Pro DES exhibit higher laccase activity than Bet:1,3-Pro DES. This suggests that the number and position of hydroxyl groups in the polyols play a crucial role in modulating laccase functionality. Additionally, molecular docking studies support the idea that hydrogen bonding between DES components and amino acids in the enzyme's catalytic cluster contributes to enhanced activity. Overall, these results provide valuable insights for designing effective DESs to improve laccase biocatalysis and expand its practical applications.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Biocatalysis; Biophysical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The ultrafast photodehydration observed affords the opportunity to probe the response of a protein to bond breaking and forming events in real time. The excited electronic state of the chromophore undergoes photodehydration with a yield estimated at several per-cent in a non-single exponential fashion in tens to hundreds of picoseconds.  The primary product formed is the cis protonated form of the GFP chromophore in a perturbed H-bonded environment. This primary product relaxes on a few microsecond timescale by a mechanism suggested to involve changes to a glutamic acid residue and modifications of the amide backbone, possibly involving a carbonyl to imine reaction. The final deprotonation of the chromophore required for on-state formation was not observed, so probably occurs in > 1 ms.

Photocatalytic activity is shown to correlate with the steady accumulation of photo-oxidised cobalt, with both being maximal at a cobalt loading of 0.67 wt.%. Ultrafast transient absorption demonstrates that picosecond reduction of accumulated oxidised cobalt is a major light-driven loss pathway which competes with the desired nanosecond photoelectron transfer to AgNO3.The optimal 0.67 wt.% cobalt loading for photocatalysis is rationalised as resulting from a compromise between maximising the density of cobalt catalytic sites for water oxidation whilst avoiding excessive losses resulting from oxidised cobalt sites functioning as recombination centres for photogenerated electrons.

Nb-doped TiO2 is a potential candidate with Nb dopant improving the conductivity of TiO2. However, its conductivity is still around 10 orders of magnitude lower than IrO2. Herein, we have fabricated a series of Ti-Nb alloy thin films with varied Nb content by sputter deposition and investigated their performance as a support for iridium oxide. Electrochemistry and accelerated stress test were conducted on these metal thin films and characterisation techniques including X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy were employed to characterise the in situ formed passivation layers during the OER. Our results suggested that a ~10 nm oxide passivation layer forms on Ti-based supports. On alloying Nb with Ti metal, a more insulating rutile Ti oxide phase forms under OER whereas an anatase Ti oxide, with higher conductivity, is observed on the undoped Ti. Consequently, although alloying with Nb improves the bulk conductivity, the structure of the oxide passive layer results in drastic decrease of conductivity, and OER activity for Nb-containing supports. Our results thus indicate the importance of the structure and composition of surface oxide phases formed during OER in controlling the overall stability and conductivity of candidate support materials.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Catalysis; Energy; Alloys; Electrocatalysis; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) and hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods to systematically investigate the influence of mesopores and EFAL on acid strength and cracking reactivity in FAU-type zeolites. Three representative models were constructed: a conventional microporous HY, an EFAL-containing HY, and a mesoporous HY.

To isolate the effect of mesoporosity, we simulate the cracking of n-hexane and 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (1,3,5-TIPB) on HY and meso-HY models. For n-hexane, mesoporosity has minimal influence on reaction energetics. In contrast, for bulky molecules such as 1,3,5-TIPB, higher free energy profiles are observed in meso-HY due to reduced framework interactions.

To elucidate the distinctive characteristics of the new sulfonium ligand, its Rh(I) carbonyl complex was subjected to a comprehensive structural (XRD) and spectroscopic (NMR, IR) analysis, in direct comparison with isostructural analogs featuring neutral P-based and anionic Si-based ligands. This study revealed systematic trends along this series, including a progressive shortening of the central E-Rh bond (E = Si, P, S) and an increasing blue shift of the CO stretching frequencies. These results were fully corroborated by density functional theory calculations, which also indicated a steady depletion of the local negative natural charge on the Rh atom along the series. Electrochemical studies (CV) further highlighted the profound effect imposed by the cationic sulfonium donor on the coordinated Rh(I) center, revealing an anodic shift of ~1.0\u202fV in its reduction potential, relative to the P-based analog.

The present framework is a variant of RAG frameworks that enables domain adaptation of a local LLM without fine-tuning and is applied to metal-sulfide photocatalyst studies. Experimental results stored in a CSV file and scientific literature written as PDF files were used as sources of domain-specific knowledge by the two retrievers of the present MDSK-RAG.

The summary is performed by the LLM based on a predefined prompt that extracts information corresponding to five aspects of metal-sulfide photocatalysts: composition, crystal structure type, synthesis method, reaction conditions, and hydrogen evolution activity. The evaluation of the generated responses to 12 expert-defined questions revealed that the present MDSK-RAG improved the scientific quality of the responses in terms of both factual correctness and expert-specific reasoning.

This fluorescence originates from extensive hydrogen bonding and electron-rich heteroatomic sub-luminophores. The fluorescence properties of these films are highly sensitive to environmental humidity. As relative humidity increases, both fluorescence intensity and lifetime decrease linearly. This phenomenon is attributed to the disruption of hydrogen bonding by absorbed water molecules, which alters the clusteroluminescence mechanism.

A linear correlation was observed between relative fluorescence intensity and the glass transition temperature (Tg), enabling the first-ever use of nonconventional fluorescence to monitor Tg variations as a function of humidity.

Here, we report a strategy for the rapid optimization of compact bispecific agents using nucleic acid hybridization to display peptide ligands for both the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and the Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition factor (MET). The self-assembly process involved 20 and 21 nucleotide (nt) long DNA peptide conjugate and 41-46 nt template strands, which precisely controlled the spatial arrangement of the EGFR-targeting peptide GE11 and the MET-binding bicyclic peptide GE137. We introduce improved synthetic methods for the challenging construction and functionalization of GE137, enabling its efficient conjugation to oligonucleotides. Systematic variation of peptide spacing revealed a striking distance-dependent affinity profile in interactions with live A549 cells, with optimal staining observed when GE11 and GE137 were separated by 21 paired and 3 unpaired DNA nucleotides. Incorporation of a cleavable cytotoxic payload (monomethyl auristatin E) into bispecific DNA-peptide constructs led to potent, HGF-dependent cytotoxicity, underscoring the requirement for targeted internalization. Conjugation to DNA effectively masked the cytotoxic payload, unless the combined activity of GE11 and GE137 induced internalization.

In the context of two critical domains energy storage and biomedical technologies, DFT plays a pivotal role in enabling rational materials design, mechanistic understanding, and performance optimization. For energy storage systems, including lithium ion batteries and beyond, DFT aids in the discovery and optimization of electrode materials, solid state electrolytes, and interfacial structures. It provides insight into ion transport pathways, redox stability, voltage profiles, and degradation mechanisms that are crucial for achieving higher energy density, safety, and sustainability. In the biomedical realm, DFT contributes to understanding drug\u2013target interactions, molecular binding mechanisms, surface reactivity of implant materials, and the development of biosensors. Its application in modeling biocompatibility, chemical reactivity under physiological conditions, and electron transfer dynamics supports the design of safer and more effective medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and diagnostic tools. This perspective presents a comprehensive overview of the advances, challenges, and future directions in applying DFT to these two technologically significant sectors. We explore methodological developments such as hybrid functionals, dispersion corrections, ab initio molecular dynamics, and machine learned potentials that enhance the scope and scalability of DFT. Furthermore, we highlight opportunities for integrating DFT with high throughput workflows, multiscale simulations, and experimental validation to enable autonomous material discovery and precision medicine.

While much research pertinent to coacervates has recently focused on their phase behavior, their glassy dynamics remains largely unexplored. We anticipated, based on the Generalized Entropy Theory (GET) of the dynamics of glass-forming liquids and recent molecular dynamics simulation studies, that variations in these material\u2019s polymer charge density should significantly alter the glass transition temperature (Tg) and fragility (m) because of the known effect of charge on the cohesive energy density of polymer materials. To test this hypothesis, we performed dielectric spectroscopy measurements on model complex coacervate films formed by blending poly-diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride (PDDA) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The critical salt concentration (csalt) was taken to be a quantitative measure of molecular interaction strength, \u0190. The films were vacuum annealed before dielectric measurements were conducted over a wide temperature range extending down to temperatures close to Tg. As anticipated, we find that increasing \u0190 progressively increases Tg but decreases m. We also find that our coacervate films exhibit high apparent dielectric permittivity (> 103) at room temperature for a moderate frequency of 1 kHz, which naturally explains the observed high responsiveness of such materials to even relatively weak electric fields ( 1 V/cm). Finally, we show that moisture tends to plasticize the glassy dynamics of these materials, i,e., reduce Tg. These trends are expected to hold rather generally for complex coacervate materials arising in diverse manufacturing and biophysical contexts.

Proteolysis targeting chimeras, or PROTACs, are an emerging class of drugs that offer the potential to develop therapeutics targeting \u201cundruggable\u201d proteins by stabilizing ternary complexes. This involves leveraging the physiological protein degradation mechanism based on ubiquitination through stabilization of target protein-E3 ubiquitin ligase protein-protein interactions (PPI) mediated by the PROTAC. Existing computational methods for ligand design typically are not designed for the ternary complex problem and limitations in accuracy are present because they use rigid docking or are inefficient because they use full molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Here we present a method which uses SILCS (site identification by ligand competitive saturation) that can address the challenges of ternary complex ligand design due to the use of precomputed ensembles of 1) functional group affinity patterns, termed FragMaps, for efficient and accurate ligand docking and of 2) a collection of putative PPI dimer 3D structures as docking targets. SILCS FragMaps are generated using aqueous, multi-solute grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC)/MD simulations to generate the FragMaps for both the target and ligase proteins. The FragMaps are then used in SILCS-PPI to generate an ensemble of candidate PPI dimer conformations. FragMaps of each dimer are generated by merging the two separate sets of FragMaps. Then a two-step SILCS-MC docking method is employed to relax PROTAC molecules into the ensemble of dimer FragMaps, and final scoring metrics are extracted from the most favorable ternary complex in the ensemble as determined by the predicted PROTAC binding affinity. Furthermore, the scoring metrics such as free energy contributions of the two warheads and linker of each PROTAC are extracted and weighted together with two physicochemical terms, the PROTAC LogP and the number of rotatable bonds, to construct an activity score. The method is benchmarked on a diverse set of ternary crystal structures with different proteins and PROTAC molecules, showing a satisfactory degree of correlation with DC50 values in cells for a wide variety of systems. Thus, the SILCS-PROTAC method is a powerful tool to facilitate ligand optimization by predicting binding geometries and energetics of ternary complexes.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biophysics; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we present a matched molecular pair study of twelve (12) 3-aryl-3-amino-oxetane and benzamide matched molecular pairs to assess their viability as isosteric replacements. Across the surveyed physicochemical properties (pH stability, solubility, lipophilicity, clearance, permeability), amino-oxetanes exhibited comparable profiles to their amide counterparts, while displaying improved solubility. The aryl amino-oxetane motif is more basic than an amide, yet offers significant reduction of amine basicity in comparison to the benzylamine. These findings support the potential of amino-oxetanes as amide replacements. However, analysis of crystal structures of the amino-oxetane and benzamide pairs highlights the conformational difference and alternative exit vectors available through introduction of the oxetane ring. Amino-oxetanes maintain both the H-bond acceptor and H-bond donor capabilities of analogous amides. Amino-oxetanes have significantly lower barriers to rotation, allowing for the potential to flexibly accommodate binding sites of interest. However, the preferred gauche conformation makes the torsion angle and exit vectors of amino-oxetanes more similar to sulfonamides, and on this basis amino-oxetanes provide better like-for-like topological replacements for sulfonamides rather than of amides.

Despite recent fundamental advances in NO3RR electrocatalysis and some proof-of-concept demonstrations of promising reactive separations unit processes, a rational approach to scale-up and deployment of these critically needed technologies remains elusive. This imperative is challenged by the impure and variable nature of nitrate-laden wastewaters. To address these challenges, and to narrow the broad engineering design space for electrocatalytic nitrate refining (that necessarily includes integrated processes for nitrogen extraction, conversion, and recovery), we pursue process modeling that bridges subunit kinetic behavior with overall process performance. In this work, we establish characteristic rate equations for the subunit processes that comprise a reactive separation called electrocatalyst-in-a-box (ECaB), which facilitates nitrate reduction in an engineered environment separate from wastewater. Integrating these equations into a continuous ECaB process model predicts performance and lays the groundwork for further optimization toward practical application in wastewater treatment. The model also enables technoeconomic analysis that facilitates comparison of component- and subunit process-level cost contributions to the overall system and provides a benchmark for reactive separations against conventional wastewater nitrogen treatment. In sum, this work provides a framework to translate fundamental unit process studies toward integrated reactive separation system design, and to uncover unit process insights within the context of an integrated system to prioritize research and development needs in membrane, catalysis, and reactor design research.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Water Purification; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To address them simultaniously in an unified framework we introduce the DeepFit, a deep learning approach for physically and chemically informed on-the-fly XANES spectra analysis. By constructing the tmXAS\u2014a comprehensive database of 67,000 possible local atomic environments and their corresponding Ab-initio K-edge XAS spectra for all 3d and 4d transition metals\u2014we leverage a state-of-the-art universal deep learning model for rapid spectral prediction.

Then, combining quantum chemistry and DeepFit neural network differentiation, we implement an approach for chemically informed atomic structure refinement, capable of $3D$ structure prediction considering both spectroscopic and energetic favorability. Domain-specific spectroscopic solutions were put in the tmXAS database and DeepFit approach to better work with often overlooked in analysis methods and highly relevant cases of homogeneous and single-site/single-atom catalysts. The method's validity for both structure refinement and spectra prediction is rigorously demonstrated with several benchmarks, including structure unraveling of the Rh-complex homogeneous hydroformylation catalyst and well-defined 3d/4d metal coordination compounds (Cu, Co, Zn, Ni), where quantitative agreement with single-crystal XRD and EXAFS is met.

Here we evaluate the tautomerase enzyme cis-CaaD and its almost exclusive conversion of ACA to intermediate product malonate semialdehyde (MSA) which can further be enzymatically converted to high priority target chemicals. We also compare cis-CaaD to the previously evaluated tautomerase Cg10062 which has 54% similarity yet in its native form does not afford primarily MSA (15% product formation) but rather follows a decarboxylation pathway to produce acetaldehyde (ACH, 85% product formation).

CD30 is a protein receptor expressed on the surface of Hodgkin's cancer cells and is a crucial target for diagnosis and treatment. As of now, current CD30-targeted therapies come with extensive side effects like peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression, and hepatic and pulmonary toxicities. Typically, the body uses Natural Killer (NK) white blood cells to control tumors and limit their spread. Still, NK cells require prior exposure to a specific pathogen and, therefore, cannot be used for targeted cancer treatment. In response, Yang et al. designed aptamers (RNA/DNA molecules) anchored to the surface of NK cells to target the CD30 receptors of Hodgkin cancer cells. In this research experiment, computational modeling of aptamers targeting CD30 receptors was simulated. Specifically, molecular docking simulations using the HDOCK software were conducted to identify aptamers that can be used as biomarkers or targeted therapies for Hodgkin lymphoma. The docked results show that the aptamer Apt3 binds strongly to Domain 3 of the CD30 receptor. These results were further validated using the graph neural network method. Additionally, a complete CD30 receptor structure was modeled using AlphaFold 3, which showed that the receptor has complex extracellular cysteine-rich domains involved in the ligand binding. It can be assumed that these cysteine-rich domains could encourage the aptamer to bind to the CD30 receptor. These results will help develop NK cell aptamer-based CD30 targeted therapies for Hodgkin lymphoma.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In analogy to this work, we present a scaffold-based analysis of bioactivity data with the focus to identify promiscuous scaffolds or fragments on a broader scale. A scaffold network was created based on the ChEMBL database, followed by the analysis of the scaffold decoration using a python based workflow and target similarity calculations. In the end, 3124 promiscuous scaffolds belonging to ligands binding to different unrelated proteins were identified. Within these scaffolds, a phenylthiophene-like scaffold was identified in ligands binding to five unrelated protein targets that show similar hydrophobic subpockets. Interestingly, a subsequent docking study revealed different binding modes of the corresponding ligands, which indicates also a promiscuous subpocket. Subsequent screening by binding site comparisons of the protein ligand complexes available in the PDB revealed Cruzipain of T. cruzi as potential new target for this specific scaffold. The binding site similarity to Cruzipain was confirmed by biochemical validation of the phenylthiophene-like scaffold as well as grown derivatives. A subsequent analysis of the REAL Space showed that these promiscuous scaffolds are also part of the ultra-large chemical space of Enamine. Together with the available commercial derivatives, these promiscuous scaffolds can be seen as a promising sociable fragment library for fragment-based design by catalogue. In contrast, this library can also be excluded from fragment libraries depending on the viewpoint if such promiscuous scaffolds are foe or friends.

Hybrid machine-learned/molecular mechanics (ML/MM) simulations offer a promising compromise between quantum accuracy and computational efficiency. However, most existing ML/MM methods exclude solvent molecules from the ML region, limiting their ability to capture solvent-mediated reactivity. In this study, we introduce a solvent-inclusive ML/MM methodology that addresses this limitation. Our approach defines the ML and MM regions using a fixed spatial boundary, avoiding costly topology updates, and handles interactions across the boundary using a force-partitioning scheme. We evaluate our framework through simulations of bulk water and the solvent-mediated dissociation of formic acid using different ML region sizes. Our results reveal that structural and dynamical properties of bulk water are preserved for sufficiently large ML regions. Notably, we show that the choice of the potential energy surface representation for the ML and MM regions can affect these properties, especially at smaller ML region sizes. Our calculations of the free energy profiles for formic acid dissociation also show trends consistent with reference systems, but deviations are observed. We comment on potential reasons for these observations.

However, obtaining reliable thermodynamic properties of HF(aq) at high-pressure and high-temperature (high P-T) conditions, typical of the Earth\u2019s crust and upper mantle, has proven challenging due to limitations in experimental techniques. This study employs an automated machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) approach that is trained on ab initio data to calculate the pKa of HF(aq) across a wide range of temperatures (150\u00b0C to 600\u00b0C) and pressures (500 bar to 20 kbar).

In case of more studied Bi/Pt systems, good agreement was found between calculated results and previously published data, both from experimental and theoretical studies. \nAt lower coverages coadsorbed Bi and Te atoms interact repulsively with each. At the coverages close to half a monolayer, however, several factors affect the overlayers\u2019 stability.

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), characterized by their crystallinity, tunable porosity, and exceptional visible-light absorption, have recently gained prominence as promising catalysts for CO2 photoreduction. Herein, we report a novel azo-linked porphyrin COF (Azo-COF-366) via in-situ linker exchange from an imine-linked COF (Im-COF-366). The integration of azo (-N=N-) linkages effectively lowers the conduction band energy level and amplifies the photocurrent response of Azo-COF-366. This synergistic effect promotes charge carrier separation efficiency and optimizes transport dynamics. Furthermore, Azo-COF-366 exhibits exceptional resistance to degradation under harsh acidic and alkaline conditions. Attributed to its superior photoelectronic properties, Azo-COF-366 exhibits superior catalytic performance, achieving an increased CO production rate (13.4 mmol\u00b7g\u20121\u00b7h\u20121) compared to Im-COF-366, along with a 30% improvement in CO and H2 selectivity. The crucial role played by azo linkages is revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicate that the incorporation of azo linkages modulates the charge density at the cobalt center and enhances its 3d-orbital splitting, which promotes more efficient electron transfer from the photosensitizer to Azo-COF-366 and reduces the energy barrier for the formation of the *COOH intermediate.

Although crystal structures provide insights into the structural basis for guanidinium ion (Gdm+) sensing by the guanidine-I riboswitch aptamer (GRA) domain, the mechanistic interplay between ligand and metal ion binding, RNA conformational changes, and regulatory function remains poorly understood. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we explore the combined effects of the positively charged Gdm+, Mg2+, and K+ observed in close proximity in the experimental crystal structure on the GRA structural dynamics. Our simulations reveal that the binding pocket frequently transitions between ligand bound-like and unbound-like states in the absence of divalent ions, while Mg2+ stabilizes a bound-like RNA conformation. Furthermore, both Mg2+ and Gdm+ facilitate K+ positioning near the binding pocket. As a result, Mg2+, Gdm+, and K+ synergistically increase the structural rigidity of the GRA domain, particularly the P2\u2013P3 junction and the 3\u2032 end near the terminator stem. This enhances localized interactions that pull the P1a and P3 domains together to make the transcriptional control region available for expression.

Despite a sizable presence in the bulk materials synthesis literature, reports of phosphosulfide thin films are extremely scarce. This may be due to the hazardous, volatile, and corrosive nature of many phosphorus and sulfur precursors, combined with the high sulfur chemical potential needed to incorporate large amounts of this volatile element in the (PS4)-3 and (P2S6)-4 thiophosphate anions that are common in this material family. \nTo overcome these limitations, we introduce directional-and-diffuse multi-anion reactive sputtering (DADMARS). DADMARS uniquely combines sputtered metal sources, reactive gas, and a thermally cracked evaporated nonmetal source with a high chemical potential to gain access to challenging multi-anion chemistries in thin-film form. \nIn this paper, we employ Cu, PH3, and Sx as the sputtered, gaseous, and evaporated sources to deposit polycrystalline Cu3PS4 thin-film thiophosphate semiconductors with the narrowest x-ray diffraction peaks recorded for a phosphosulfide thin film. Single-phase Cu3PS4 can be grown over relatively large areas (8\u00d78 cm2 and extendable) at temperatures down to 375 \u00b0C, which is lower than for similar sulfide semiconductors CuInS2 and Cu2ZnSnS4. This suggests potential compatibility with established device fabrication processes. Cu3PS4 thin films exhibit remarkable environmental, radiation, and chemical stability, with negligible etch rates in the 0-14 pH range. Thin-film Cu3PS4 is a p-type semiconductor with a bandgap of 2.3-2.5 eV, strong light absorption, and detectable photoluminescence at room temperature. This combination of stability and optoelectronic properties positions Cu3PS4 as a promising earth-abundant semiconductor for photoelectrochemical applications.\n", "date": "2025-08-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Energy; Thin Films", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Here, we investigate how a platinum electrode influences the dynamics of a ruthenium-catalyzed BZ reaction. We observe a pronounced acceleration of the oscillation frequency that scales with the electrode\u2019s surface to solution-volume ratio. In addition, we demonstrate that small DC currents (<0.4 mA) further modulate the effect up to a full recovery of the natural period. To explain these findings, we develop a quantitative model based on mixed-potential theory, which accurately captures the observed behavior. This framework reveals how the low-volume electrochemical conversion of molecules at the electrode's surface gets amplified by the chemistry and finally causes a pronounced impact on the entire system.

However, integrating nutrient recovery into wastewater treatment trains requires long-term stability of recovery-focused technologies. Electrochemical stripping (ECS) has shown promise for ammonia recovery across diverse wastewaters, but its long-term operation is hindered by cation exchange membrane (CEM) fouling where constituents present in wastewater accumulate on the membrane surface. In this study, we identified the distribution and speciation of dominant foulants on CEMs during ECS-based ammonia recovery from hydrolyzed urine, reverse osmosis concentrate, and anaerobic digester effluent using advanced X-ray imaging and spectroscopy techniques. Micro-X ray fluorescence showed substantial deposition of Ca, P, and S on the CEM, and Ca K-edge spectroscopy indicated the presence of calcium carbonate polymorphs, calcium phosphates, and calcium associated with organic matter. Building on these insights from spectroscopic investigations, we evaluated the efficacy of complexing agents (citric acid,ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid [EDTA]) and antiscalants (acrylate- and phosphonate-based) in preventing fouling. Aqueous measurements showed that EDTA and an acrylate-based antiscalant inhibited Ca precipitation without compromising ammonia recovery. Ex-situ \u00b5-XRF and \u00b5-XANES characterization further quantified the spatial distribution and chemical forms of residual foulants, demonstrating effective mitigation by selected additives.

Catechol, the most abundant isomer of benzenediol in biomass burning emissions, undergoes oxidation in the aqueous phase of cloud droplets to form secondary organic aerosol (SOA), including products that absorb light at visible wavelengths, brown carbon (BrC) chromophores. After cloud evaporation, the remaining submicron SOA particles are susceptible to further oxidant- and light-driven processing. Here, we investigate the multiphase ozone oxidation of the reaction mixture from the aqueous OH-initiated oxidation of catechol, i.e., simulated OH-driven processing in clouds, using a coated-wall flow-tube apparatus. Reactive uptake of ozone was determined for thin films from the OH-driven processing of catechol with and without further irradiation of the thin films, i.e., simulated light-driven processing after cloud evaporation, at low and moderate relative humidity (RH). The experimental time series were reproduced using kinetic multilayer modeling, which, along with qualitative microscopy experiments, provided insights into the diffusivity of these materials. After OH-driven processing, the thin films exhibited uptake coefficients of 2 x 10\u22126 and 9 x 10\u22126 at 0 and 50% RH, respectively, and 4 h of exposure to 130 ppb of ozone. After OH- and light-driven processing, the uptake coefficients were lower, 2 x 10\u22127 at 0% RH and 4 x 10\u22126 at 50% RH, for the same ozone exposure. Consequently, the reaction mixture of catechol was plasticized upon uptake of water vapor but vitrified under UV irradiation. Kinetic multilayer modeling shows that slower ozone diffusion at low RH and after light-driven processing can lead to an increase in the atmospheric lifetime of reactive species from less than 1 h to more than a day.

We report a hydrophobic core-substituted naphthalenediimide that self-assembles in water-dioxane mixtures to form a pair of 2D poly-morphs, with distinct morphological, optical and surface characteristics. Changing the solvent composition or temperature prompts an in-situ transformation between the two polymorphs in solution.

Different arrangements of perfluoroalkyl sidechains at the exposed 2D surface of the two polymorphs result in difference in solvent-solute interactions at the solid-liquid interface, which affects the surface free-energy and relative stability in different solvent compositions.

However, their practical application is hindered by poor cycling stability and limited rate capability, largely attributed to unfavored kinetics and interfacial degradation, especially in conversion-type cathodes. Previous studies have shown that the application of stack pressure can significantly improve the cell\u2019s cycling stability. To reveal the underlying mechanism, this study systematically investigates the impact of stack pressure on the electrochemical performance of ASSFIBs using BiF\u2083|BaSnF\u2084|Sn cells. Among the tested conditions, the best enhancement of cycling stability and rate performance were demonstrated under 180 MPa. Furthermore, ex-situ diffraction analysis revealed pressure-dependent phase evolution and oxygen-related interfacial degradation (i.e., BiOF or BiO0.1O2.8 formation) in the BiF\u2083 cathode during the first cycle. Through in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy combined with distribution of relaxation times analysis we identified charge transfer and F\u207b diffusion as the dominant state-of-charge dependent kinetic limitations, with strong correlation to phase transitions within the BiF\u2083 cathode composite. These findings emphasize the critical role of stack pressure in mitigating interfacial degradation and optimizing ion transport, providing valuable insights for the design and operation of high-performance ASSFIBs.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Nanoscience; Energy; Composites; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

While most studies focus on proteinogenic amino acids, the influence of non-proteinogenic amino acids, abundant in early planetary environments, remains under-explored. This study employs molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the adsorption of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a non-proteinogenic amino acid, and two positively charged amino acids, l-arginine and l-lysine, onto calcium montmorillonite clay (STx-1b). Baseline adsorption behaviors were quantified for each amino acid in isolation and compared to mixed systems containing GABA with either l-arginine or l-lysine. The results show that GABA decreased the overall adsorption probability of both l-arginine and l-lysine by ~13%, due to competitive interactions for clay surface sites. For l-arginine, backbone nitrogen and oxygen adsorption decreased, while for l-lysine, sidechain nitrogen adsorption decreased, but oxygen adsorption increased. In this case, cationic bridging via the Ca2+ ion was observed in the presence of GABA, though absent for pure l-lysine or any l-arginine systems. Unlike l-arginine and l-lysine, GABA was much more likely to form clusters of molecules. In the solo GABA system, these clusters formed around Ca2+ ions which bridged to the clay. These clusters occurred more often when l-arginine and l-lysine were present. However, in lysine - GABA systems these clusters were less commonly interacting with the clay and more likely to form away from the surface. These findings highlight the complex interplay of amino acids on clay surfaces, offering insights into molecular organization processes relevant to the proto-biomaterial preservation and transfer on early Earth and Mars environments.", "date": "2025-08-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Geochemistry; Space Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Among other classes, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are bifunctional molecules that induce the proximity of a recruiter E3 ligase and the target protein of interest for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. While most PROTACs are non-covalent interactors, covalent PROTACs may benefit from increased selectivity and improved pharmacodynamics, yet remain largely understudied. In this context, a gold-based PROTAC (AuPROTAC) was synthesized, consisting of a cyclometalated Au(III) warhead, known to induce covalent cysteine-arylation in a gold-templated two-step mechanism, linked to a cereblon binding moiety. The degradome of the covalent AuPROTAC was characterized by establishing a cycloheximide chase assay, which was performed in a non-proliferative steady-state HL-60 cell culture system that maintained a static protein turnover and efficiently decoupled protein degradation from down-regulation. The method was verified with the known SMARCA2 and PBRM1-degrader ACBI2. Interestingly, amongst the possible targets, AuPROTAC could degrade the oncogenic tyrosine kinase MERTK and the thioredoxin-like 1 protein TXNL1, while their degradation was successfully rescued by proteasome inhibition. The investigated PROTACs were found to affect protein half-lives; therefore, proteome-wide degradation selectivity was further characterized by ranking degraded targets based on the acceleration of protein half-lives. Interestingly, the AuPROTAC degraded a relatively limited number of proteins (95) when compared to the targeted ACBI2 (221).

Their potential in rational enzyme engineering makes them valuable for the synthesis of diverse C-glycosides. However, the detailed reaction mechanism remains unclear. To address this, we investigated the C-glycosylation of phloretin catalyzed by the glycosyltransferase GgCGT in the presence of the coenzyme UDP-glucose. Using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations on a cluster model, we identified the most favorable pathway for C-glycosylation. The reaction proceeds via an initial proton transfer from phloretin to UDP-glucose, followed by the nucleophilic attack of phloretin on the glucose moiety and subsequent dissociation of UDP in an SN2-like manner. The SN2 step yields non-aromatic intermediate, which can be rapidly converted to C-glycoside even without an enzymatic environment. The key residue that facilitates the rate-determining SN2 step is His-27, which stabilizes phloretin via hydrogen bonding. Additionally, to clarify why alternative products such as O-glycosides are not formed, we also investigated the O-glycosylation pathway. Our calculations revealed that O-glycosylation was promoted by proton transfer from UDP-glucose, like C-glycosylation, but was suppressed by structural fixation due to hydrogen bonding among phloretin, glucose, and GgCGT.

To address this challenge, composite zeolite granules (1-2 mm) coated with an iron (oxyhydr)oxide layer were synthesized using a two-stage process. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the resulting coating consists of rounded nanoparticles with a morphology characteristic of weakly crystalline 2-line ferrihydrite. The adsorption and stabilizing properties of natural and composite granules were evaluated using three test series: adsorption from a single-component cadmium solution; adsorption from a multicomponent \u201csoil solution\u201d; and an experiment in pots. \nThe adsorption of cadmium by both materials is best described by a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The maximum cadmium adsorption capacities, as determined by the Langmuir model, were 12.96 mg/g for natural zeolite and 15.37 mg/g for composite zeolite. Cadmium uptake increased with rising pH and declined in solutions of higher ionic strength. Desorption tests suggested weak binding of cadmium to the iron (oxyhydr)oxide surface through outer-sphere complexation over a short adsorption interval.

The ability to manipulate a single interaction out of a collection of noncovalent interactions can arguably affect cooperativity and thus alter supramolecular chirality. We present such an interaction-specific control over supramolecular chirality in the aqueous self-assembly of a pair of enantiomeric perylene bisimides. Each enantiomer assembles into three distinct chiral states, including a pair of mirror-image structures. These can be accessed either by specific heating/cooling protocols or varying the water-cosolvent ratio. An unprecedented control over this complex self-assembly landscape is achieved by selectively and reversibly turning-off the carboxylic acid mediated hydrogen-bonding interaction, such that the assembly can be guided towards any specific chiral state in a deterministic fashion. The generality of our strategy is demonstrated by carrying out similar supramolecular stereomutation for structurally related molecules.\n", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Self-Assembly; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, conventional heptamethine cyanine fluorophores are symmetric in nature which favors fluorophore self-assembly from \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking in aqueous media. This aggregation significantly reduces fluorescence intensity and hampers imaging performance. Although a few non-aggregating heptamethine cyanines have been reported, no general strategy has been established for synthesizing non-aggregating heptamethine cyanine. Here, we introduce a broadly applicable approach to prevent aggregation by breaking the molecular symmetry of heptamethine cyanines through selective substitution along the polymethine backbone. This structural asymmetry disrupts \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions without adversely affecting the desirable photophysical properties of the dyes. The strategy accommodates a wide range of indolenine and polymethine substituents that enable development of a diverse library of non-aggregating heptamethine cyanines. One of the unsymmetrical heptamethine cyanine dyes, SAT-IR-746, was further characterized for its aggregation behavior. SAT-IR-746 remained monomeric in water and across a range of salt concentrations, indicating strong resistance to salt-induced aggregation. Furthermore, a carboxylic acid derivative of SAT-IR-746 was converted to an NHS ester and conjugated to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) via lysine residues. The resulting IgG\u2013SAT-IR-746 conjugates showed no signs of aggregation, further confirming the dye\u2019s stability in both solution and protein-bound states.

This scoring function has been carefully tuned using Absolute Binding Free Energy Perturbation calculations (ABFEP). Compared with Glide SP, Glide WS offers significant gains in the two primary tasks for molecular docking in drug discovery, pose prediction and virtual screening enrichment.

Both small-molecule organic fluorophores and conjugated polymers have been used to fabricate fluorescent nanoparticles. However, factors controlling the fluorescence characteristics of the two types of nanoparticles are not well understood.

We found that the fluorescent nanodots consisting of the D-A-D small molecules consistently exhibited brighter fluorescence than the (D-A)n conjugated polymers. We separated the contributions of light absorption and emission to the fluorescence brightness using single-particle fluorescence microscopy, which revealed that the enhancement of both light absorption efficiency (i.e., molar extinction coefficient) and light-emitting efficiency (i.e., fluorescence quantum yield) resulted in the observed brighter fluorescence of the small-molecule dots compared with the polymer dots. DFT calculation and other spectroscopic studies suggested that a less twisted conformation (i.e., more planar conformation) of the molecules in the small-molecule dots directly caused the enhanced molar extinction coefficient. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements suggested that this planarization upon particle formation indirectly resulted in the improved fluorescence quantum yield through the enhancement of the radiative rate. The single-particle excitation polarization modulation experiment demonstrated a more ordered overall orientation of the individual molecules in the small-molecule dots.

However, most of the insofar application of BET conducts this association without considering the robust mathematical basis supporting BET. Consequently, misinterpretations and incorrect results have arisen because of the inherent ambiguity of such an oversight. The proper utilization of BET involves the calculation of the Hessian matrix at potentially degenerate critical points of the electron localization function (ELF) and measuring their relative distance along a reactive coordinate. This methodical approach is tailored to incorporate key CT concepts into the original BET framework, thereby recovering the rigor of the latter. The systematic application of these steps has led to various unexpected outcomes, including the correlation between electron density symmetry and CT\u2019s polynomials, the interplay between these polynomials and the heterolytic/homolytic character of bond breakages, and a CT-based model for scaling bond polarity.

However, the influence of backbone substituents on orientation has received virtually no attention, despite the fact that backbone interactions are critical for upright orientation of thiolate-based SAMs and that backbone functionalization is important for many applications. To address this question, a series of gold nanoparticles (NPs) supported by NHCs featuring symmetrical or asymmetrical long alkyl backbone substituents and ethyl and isopropyl wingtips were synthesized. The gold NPs were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, electron microscopy, mass spectrometry, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Experimental SER spectra were compared to simulated spectra, illustrating that both ethyl and isopropyl NHCs with symmetrical dodecyl long chains in the backbone adopt a primarily vertical configuration on the gold surface. However, the ethyl NHC with a single hexyloxy backbone substituent adopts mainly a flat configuration on the gold NP surface based on combined SERS and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results. This is attributed to on-surface interactions between long alkyl chains, which provide an unanticipated source of stability favoring the flat-lying orientation. Lastly, the thermal stability of the NHC-functionalized gold NPs at elevated temperatures was investigated. The dodecyloxy-functionalized NHC AuNPs remain thermally stable for 72 hours at 100\u00b0C, representing a significant improvement over state-of-the-art NHC-AuNPs. NHCs containing isopropyl wingtip groups provide NPs with higher levels of stability than diethyl-substituted NHCs, regardless of backbone substituents. Taken together, our results highlight critical synthetic considerations for NHC ligand design, enabling control of ligand orientation and nanomaterial stability by tuning NHC backbone substituents.

Particularly, the ultrafast charge transfer process between electron donor and acceptor species in functional energy materials is influenced by vibronic coherences. A key limitation arises from the dephasing of coherences due to dissipation, causing loss of information and limiting applications of molecular systems. Extending and controlling coherence lifetimes would enable the rational design of smarter materials with optimised properties. Here we introduce a novel idea using chirped excitations as a pathway to extend quantum coherence lifetimes, enhancing their robustness against dissipation. A detailed analysis of the light-induced molecular quantum dynamics and wave packet evolution from first-principles models constructed at the donor\u2013acceptor heterojunction of an organic photovoltaic blend is discussed. We demonstrate that tuning the chirp of the excitation pulse, vibronic coherence lifetimes can be extended up to the picosecond timescale. Chirped excitations also enable tunable spatial localisation of the induced wave packet, with localisation controlled by the chirp intensity. These effects are observed consistently across different donor\u2013acceptor adducts selected from the molecular dynamics structure of the blend. Our results introduce a new degree of freedom for coherent control in molecular systems, offering a promising pathway toward the development of advanced functional energy materials and applications in molecular quantum information science.

However, due to the lack of non-rubber components such as phospholipids and proteins, the mechanical properties of SR, such as strength and toughness, are far inferior to those of NR. It is reasonable to assume that the mechanical properties of rubbers are largely governed by chain networks. The coexistence of physical entanglements and chemical crosslinks makes it difficult to distinguish their respective contributions. We elucidate the influence of physical entanglement using a series of model mixtures consisting of ultrahigh-molecular-weight (UHMW) uncross-linked rubber with its chemical identical unentangled oligomers. The concentration of physical entanglements can be quantitatively controlled and determined using rheological measurements. Uniaxial tensile results reveal that intense entanglement network limits the maximum draw ratio of rubber, while slightly reducing the entanglement concentration could promote their elongation behavior. Due to the lack of stress transmitters, mixtures with higher amount of oligomer fraction become brittle and soft. Combined with true stress-strain curves analysis, in situ synchrotron Wide Angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD) results provide conclusive evidence that the stretching induced crystallization (SIC) is delayed at higher strains with decreasing UHMW polymer content and is inversely proportional to the entanglement concentration.

In this study, we present observations of attachment of amorphous particles to the surfaces of a metal-organic framework (MOF). The attaching particles crystallize at the particle-MOF interface and merge with the growing crystal, leading to the eventual formation of smooth surfaces. The crystal edges exhibit faster attachment rates, while the centers grow more slowly, resulting in a highly unusual morphology. The MOF presents a multidomain appearance with unexpected single crystallinity. Using a combined approach of correlative atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, we found that the multidomain structure arises from varying growth rates at different regions of the crystals.

Herein, we have developed a self-assembly fractionation method for the focusing of a polymer, with the transitioning into collective-chain micelles in a solvent-nonsolvent medium as a driving tool. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, a unique inverse main chain-side chain amphiphilic polymer architecture has been designed into a squaramide condensation polymer, with a polar solvophilic main chain and a nonpolar solvophobic side chain. This architecture provides a hitherto elusive contrast to the currently dominating canonical amphiphilic polymer architecture for addition polymers, with a nonpolar solvophobic main chain and a polar solvophilic side chain. As such, the squaramide condensation polymer synthesized herein has showcased the intriguing self-assembly into primary micelle and compound micelle constructs, allowing for fractionation into varied chain length fractions, each with a narrow polydispersity.

As a consequence of the vast and sparsely explored landscape of potential catalyst systems, exploitation of the potential of simple metal and organic catalysts has been limited. Here, we exploit an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven discovery framework that uniquely integrates Bayesian optimization (BO), large language models (LLMs), and high-throughput robotics to accelerate the search for Lewis acid-base catalysts for PET glycolysis. Beginning with a literature-guided baseline, BO leveraged LLM-derived semantic embeddings of chemical knowledge to navigate a high-dimensional catalyst space of 11,160 possible systems, systematically identifying promising candidates beyond the initial state-of-the-art. The LLM further analysed experimental results to generate interpretable, data-driven hypotheses, guiding new experiments that surpassed the baseline performance. These insights enabled inductive, human-led extrapolation beyond the predefined chemical space, resulting in the discovery of a zinc pivalate/N,N'-diethylethylenediamine catalyst system achieving a 95% BHET yield in 20 minutes, with robust performance maintained upon scale-up. Mechanistic analysis revealed a synergistic dual-site activation mechanism and facilitated the derivation of transferable design principles for acid\u2013base catalysis.

Machine learning models, especially those based on transformer architectures, are increasingly used to make these predictions from chemical structures. Inspired by recent progress in natural language processing, many studies have adopted encoder-only transformer architectures similar to BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for this task. These models are pretrained using masked language modeling, where parts of the input are hidden and the model learns to recover them before fine-tuning on downstream tasks.  In this work, we systematically investigate whether core assumptions from natural language processing, which are commonly adopted in molecular BERT-based models, actually hold when applied to molecules represented using the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES). Specifically, we examine how masking ratio, pretraining dataset size, and model size affect performance in molecular property prediction.  We find that higher masking ratios than commonly used significantly improve performance. In contrast, increasing model or pretraining dataset size quickly leads to diminishing returns, offering no consistent benefit while incurring significantly higher computational cost. Based on these insights, we develop MolEncoder, a BERT-based model that outperforms existing approaches on drug discovery tasks while being more computationally efficient.  Our results highlight key differences between molecular pretraining and natural language processing, showing that they require different design choices.

Overall, 53% of all observed emissions can be attributed to specific causal categories, with the rest comprising normal operational emissions. While abnormal tank emissions were the most common cause, unloading events exhibited the highest average emission rate.  Importantly, we find that large release events are not driven by fundamentally different causal mechanisms than those of small emitters, indicating that escalation due to specific operational conditions, rather than fundamentally distinct causes, drives high-magnitude emissions. In addition, we observe statistically significant quarterly and inter-operator variability in the prevalence of different causal categories, reinforcing the need for adaptive, operator-specific mitigation strategies.

Crystalline zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are co-melted with the chelating ligand 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), yielding modified glasses with substantially reduced glass transition temperatures. In Co2+-based systems, phen coordinated directly to the metal nodes, increasing coordination number and reducing network connectivity through the formation of terminal ligands. This coordination sphere engineering affords a level of structural control not readily achievable in conventional inorganic or organic glasses. Crucially, phen suppresses thermal decomposition, enabling the synthesis of Co2+-based MOF glasses free of magnetic impurities. These glasses exhibit antiferromagnetic coupling and represent unique examples of magnetic MOF glasses formed by melt-quenching. This strategy provides a versatile route to MOF glasses with tailored connectivity and metal-centred properties, expanding the design space of hybrid glass materials.

Traditional enhanced sampling techniques typically rely on bias potentials or elevated temperatures to facilitate such transitions, and the unbiased path sampling methods may be computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new idea towards rapid generation of transition pathways for rare events using a computationally efficient direction-guided adaptive sampling protocol that preferentially selects trajectories progressing toward the desired goal, which may be either to escape from a local minimum (e.g. drug unbinding) or reaching a specific target (e.g. protein folding with known target structure) in a pre-defined progress variable space. This approach leverages the idea that rare events are typically associated with short transition time, but very long waiting time. Our method attempts to quickly identify such transition pathways using ultrashort (tens of femtoseconds), rapidly monitored trajectories (samplers) initiated with randomized velocities, selectively propagating those exhibiting desired movement in a collective variable (CV) space. Demonstrating broad applicability and effectiveness, we apply this framework to diverse rare event scenarios, including multiple ligand unbinding pathways in T4 Lysozyme and Abl kinase proteins, and (un)folding events in fast-folding proteins (Trp-cage and Protein G). Our results show that this approach dramatically accelerates pathway generation (within a few hundred picoseconds) while staying close to the minimum free energy pathways providing viable starting points for other advanced path sampling methods like transition path sampling (TPS) and weighted ensemble (WE) simulations. Moreover, this method is able to identify multiple competing pathways with an approximate estimate of their relative population.

A critical challenge is the removal of HCPs from the final drug product as they can be detrimental to product efficacy and patient safety, even at low levels. HCP clearance is monitored during process optimisation and assessed before product release. Tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is increasingly utilized as an orthogonal method to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for HCP monitoring during downstream processing due to its untargeted nature and ability to determine total HCP concentrations. The dynamic range of the recombinant proteins makes detection of low-level HCPs difficult. However, the recently developed Orbitrap Astral MS has the potential to overcome such challenges, having previously demonstrated significant improvements in protein identifications in complex sample matrices while simultaneously reducing analysis times. Here we utilise the Orbitrap Astral MS to perform HCP analysis on a cohort of 37 protein biotherapeutics. Its speed and sensitivity enable the use of a short 60 samples-per-day (SPD; 24-minute injection to injection) separation method, dramatically reducing analysis time compared to standard LC-MS methods without sacrificing HCP identifications. 544 HCPs were detected across the cohort and 63.60% of those found to be quantifiable in at least one product using Hi3 quantitation.

Dietary exposure to acrylamide has emerged as a significant public health concern, particularly in foods subjected to frying, roasting, or grilling. In India, street-vended and fast foods are an integral part of urban and semi-urban diets, especially among younger populations. However, systematic data on acrylamide levels in these foods remain limited. This study aims to profile acrylamide concentrations in a variety of popular Indian street and fast foods, offering insight into potential exposure risks. A total of 15 ready-to-eat food samples were collected from prominent street food hubs in Bengaluru, Karnataka, during peak evening hours, representing a range of North and South Indian culinary styles. Selected items included fried snacks (e.g., samosa, pakora, bhaji), grilled or tandoor-based products (e.g., kebabs, paneer tikka), deep-fried fast food (e.g., French fries, burgers), and smoky-flavoured roasted items. Sample preparation and extraction were performed using dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME), a rapid and efficient method optimized for complex food matrices. Acrylamide quantification was carried out using gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) with appropriate calibration curves and quality control standards to ensure analytical accuracy.\nThe results revealed notable variability in acrylamide concentrations across different food categories, with deep-fried snacks exhibiting the highest levels. Items prepared at higher oil temperatures or for extended cooking durations consistently showed elevated acrylamide content. Street-vended snacks with prolonged oil reuse also demonstrated increased concentrations, indicating a possible compounding effect of cooking practices. This investigation underscores the potential dietary risk associated with frequent consumption of high-acrylamide street foods, particularly for adolescents and young adults who constitute a major consumer group. Although mitigation strategies such as optimized cooking temperatures, reduced frying times, and alternative preparation methods were not the central focus of this work, the findings emphasize the urgent need for public awareness campaigns and regulatory attention. Future studies could extend this research to seasonal variations, diverse regional cuisines, and consumer exposure modelling using dietary intake surveys.

Since industrial sectors frequently demand improvements in operational efficiency, product quality, and safety, it is plausible that robust and adaptable control systems are increasingly necessary to accommodate varying capacity requirements. The investigation made use of a real-world dataset alongside a simulated refinery dataset from the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process to benchmark the selected control strategies under diverse disturbances and process conditions. Evidence suggests that neural network-based controllers frequently achieved superior disturbance rejection and more accurate setpoint tracking than conventional PID or MPC designs. The evaluation was based on established quantitative measures, including the Integral of Squared Error (ISE) and the Integral of Absolute Error (IAE). The data seems to indicate that the enhanced performance of neural network controllers may be associated with their ability to model nonlinear process dynamics more effectively. However, challenges relating to their implementation in safety\u2013critical environments, including operational and computational constraints, should be addressed. One interpretation is that the findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of process control and could provide practitioners with guidance on combining advanced and classical methods.

However, this assumption may overlook emergent molecular trade-offs that arise during the optimization process. This study presents AMODO-EO (Adaptive Multi-Objective Drug Optimization with Emergent Objectives), a computational framework designed to discover and integrate new chemically meaningful objectives during active optimization.\nAMODO-EO builds on established principles from symbolic regression and automated feature engineering. It operates by generating candidate objective functions from molecular descriptors using mathematical transformations such as ratios, products, and differences. These candidates are evaluated for statistical independence from existing objectives, sufficient variance across the population, and chemical interpretability. Validated objectives are incorporated into the optimization process using adaptive weighting and conflict resolution mechanisms.\nThe framework was tested on benchmark datasets and two ChEMBL subsets targeting the dopamine D2 receptor. Initial objectives included binding affinity (pIC\u2085\u2080), a drug-likeness composite score, and synthetic accessibility. AMODO-EO consistently identified emergent objectives such as the hydrogen bond acceptor to rotatable bond ratio (HBA/RTB), MW/TPSA ratio, and LogP \u00d7 aromatic ring count. These objectives passed statistical filters and were chemically interpretable, suggesting they capture relevant trade-offs not encoded in the original objective set.\nOptimization performance was evaluated using hypervolume indicators and compared against baseline NSGA-II runs. AMODO-EO maintained competitive performance on original objectives, with a modest reduction in hypervolume (1.5\u20132.9%), attributed to the computational cost of discovery. Ablation studies confirmed that statistical filtering and interpretability checks are essential for maintaining optimization quality and avoiding spurious objectives.\nThe inclusion of emergent objectives expanded the Pareto front into higher-dimensional spaces, revealing new solution clusters with distinct chemical profiles. For example, the HBA/RTB ratio highlighted a polarity-flexibility trade-off relevant to ligand design. This objective was consistently discovered across all runs and parameter settings, indicating robustness of the discovery mechanism. Other emergent objectives, such as the Selectivity Score and Synthetic Complexity metric, provided additional design axes that could inform compound prioritization.\nSensitivity analysis showed that AMODO-EO is stable across a range of parameter values, including correlation thresholds, learning rates, and weight-mixing parameters. The framework\u2019s reliance on interpretable descriptor relationships ensures that discovered objectives are scientifically grounded and potentially actionable in medicinal chemistry workflows.\nWhile AMODO-EO currently uses predefined functional forms and semi-automated interpretability checks, future work may incorporate grammar-based symbolic regression and ontology-driven validation to enhance discovery scope and automation. The framework is applicable to various chemical optimization contexts and can be integrated with generative models or molecular simulation pipelines.\nIn summary, AMODO-EO provides a structured approach to discovering emergent objectives in drug optimization. It extends existing MOO techniques by enabling dynamic expansion of the objective space, offering a more comprehensive view of molecular trade-offs. The framework demonstrates that adaptive objective discovery can be achieved without compromising optimization performance, and that chemically interpretable objectives can be systematically identified from descriptor data.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, controlling fibrillar alignment over extended lengths remains a challenge. Here, we report a shear-induced method to fabricate one-dimensional gel noodles with enhanced macroscopic alignment using dipeptide-based gelators. By optimizing the extensional viscosity and shear flow conditions, we produced thin segments of gel noodles with improved internal alignment compared to traditional syringe-pump extrusion. Polarized optical microscopy and small-angle neutron scattering confirmed superior fibrillar orientation in the thin noodles. Mechanical testing revealed that enhanced alignment led to a ~400-fold increase in tensile stress resistance of 2NapFF, with ultimate stress rising from 20-50 kPa in thick noodles to 10-20 MPa in the thin segments. The method was effective across multiple gelators, including LD-2NapFF, 4BPFF, and 1ThNapFF, demonstrating its broad applicability for tuning macroscopic alignment in gel noodles. The biological relevance of thin 4BPFF noodles was demonstrated in C2C12 myoblast cultures, which showed improved cell adhesion, elongation, and myogenic differentiation compared to the thick segment.

Murakami", "abstract": "Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have advanced rapidly; however, the typical set of additives for hole transport materials (HTMs), including 4-tert-butylprydine (tBP), is still commonly used ever since the discovery of the first solid-state PSCs, regardless of its potential negative effects. The tBP is considered detrimental to PSCs because it can react with perovskite crystals. In particular, the reactions between tBP and the Pb2+ cation, a perovskite component, have been well acknowledged. In contrast, the interactions between tBP and alkylammoniums, another perovskite component, has sparsely been investigated despite the widespread use of tBP, hindering the development of PSCs. In this work, the mechanisms of interactions between tBP and alkylammoniums are revealed via theoretical studies. In the case of n-octylammonium (OA), up to three tBP molecules stabilize the ammonium moiety in OA via coordination with strong hydrogen bonding between the nitrogen in tBP and hydrogen in the ammonium moiety of OA. Up to three more tBP molecules can coordinate via weak hydrogen bonding to already coordinated tBP molecules. Leveraging this characteristic, herein, the mechanism of spontaneous perovskite passivation is investigated using an HTM solution containing tBP and an OA-based additive (OA-TFSI). The OA unit coordinated to 3 tBP molecules was found to directly chemisorb on the perovskite surface. However, the revealed chemisorption led to the formation of substantial physical space between OA and the perovskite surface, impeding hole injection from the perovskite to HTM. Finally, a method to address this issue is experimentally demonstrated: post-heating removed the coordination of bulky tBP molecules, facilitating hole injection via close adsorption of solo OA cations on the perovskite surface, enhancing the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. This study provides profound insights into the tBP effects, an unexplored aspect in PSC studies, as well as the nascent yet potent spontaneous perovskite passivation techniques.

Herein, we report the first example of a molecular weight-controlled synthesis of a poly(orthoester) (up to Mn = 149 kDa) by cationic ring-opening polymerization of a spirocyclic orthoester monomer. The simultaneous high reactivity and coordinating nature of the orthoester monomer posed significant challenges, necessitating the development of a tridentate halogen bond donor catalyst to selectively promote reversible-deactivation polymerization while suppressing undesired monomer activation. Mechanistic studies revealed that the immortal nature of the polymerization enables molecular weight control, with chain livingness maintained despite irreversible termination reactions, owing to degenerative chain transfer through the poly(orthoester) backbone.

Existing approaches often suffer from arbitrariness in reference selection, limited applicability, or high computational cost. In particular, the balance of \u03c0-energy between the target molecule and its strain-free references has long been overlooked, which is critical for \u03c0-conjugated systems. Here, we introduce \u201cautodesmotic reactions\u201d as a general and efficient strategy for reliable SE evaluation in polycyclic aromatic nanocarbons. An autodesmotic reaction transforms a strained molecule into a uniquely defined single-molecule reference. This reference resides within a virtual strain-free chemical space derived from physically motivated models trained on planar benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Crucially, preservation of molecular topology ensures both unique reference choice and proper \u03c0-energy balance. Benchmarking against asymptotic and StrainViz models across diverse carbon nanobelts (CNBs) validates the accuracy and robustness of the approach. It is broadly applicable to both macrocyclic and nonmacrocyclic systems while requiring only a single quantum chemical calculation per molecule. Applications to more challenging systems, including helicene-containing and saddle-shaped CNBs, helicenes, bowl-shaped PAHs, carbon nanotubes, and fullerenes, demonstrate high computational efficiency and provide valuable insights into strain\u2013structure\u2013property relationships. Overall, autodesmotic reactions establish a general, conceptually transparent, and efficient framework for SE analysis in \u03c0-conjugated nanocarbons.

Iron-sulfur clusters are ubiquitous and versatile metallocofactors capable of catalyzing challenging multielectron, multiproton-driven reactions that are essential to life on Earth. Exquisite catalytic efficiency and selectivity are enabled for a remarkable breadth of reactions by changes to the cluster core configuration together with primary and outer coordination sphere effects. The latter represents a powerful means of tuning cofactor structure and function, including by hydrogen bonding effects, electric field effects, hydrophobic effects, and cooperative substrate activation and delivery. Decades of intensive research on synthetic iron-sulfur cofactor models has led to an improved understanding of structure and function, but modelling the specific impact of the outer coordination sphere remains exceptionally challenging owing to difficulties in synthetically manipulating its structure. Herein, we introduce a molecular host-guest approach for the selective and systematic tuning of the outer coordination sphere of synthetic iron-sulfur cofactor models. Thus, cofactors [Fe4S4(SR)4]2\u2013 [1R]2\u2013 in which R = Ph ([1Ph]2\u2013), -CH2CH2OH ([1OH]2\u2013, or tBu ([1tBu]2\u2013) are readily encapsulated inside self-assembled, tetrahedral [M4L6]8+ molecular cages functionalized with electron-deficient naphthalenediimide (NDI) panels and M2+ corner nodes (M = Ni, Fe, Zn). Robust cofactor encapsulation is conclusively established by 1H and DOSY NMR spectroscopy, ESI mass spectrometry, and electronic absorption, nuclear absorption, and vibrational spectroscopies. The impact of cage encapsulation on the electronic structure of the cofactors is interrogated using 57Fe M\u00f6ssbauer and Fe 2p and S 2p X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy coupled with infrared and UV-vis spectroscopy, demonstrating a substantial increase in the electropositive character at Fe and attendant increase in covalency on encapsulation. These effects are attributed to hydrogen bonding, noncovalent  interactions, and non-specific hydrophobic interactions between the NDI panels and thiolate substituents, which result in net electron density withdrawal from the Fe centers. Differences in the magnitude of these effects, where [1Ph]2\u2013 > [1OH]2\u2013 \u2265 [1tBu]2\u2013, are proposed to result from the extent of host-guest binding interactions, which is influenced by the type of interaction and relative sizes of the host cavity and guest. These studies establish molecular cages as a powerful means of tuning cofactor electronic structure via outer-sphere noncovalent effects, and shed light on the impact of the hydrophobic cage environment on the electronic and bonding character of the cluster core. \u2003", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Nanoscience; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Electrochemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Inorg.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Mitochondrial membrane potential, in turn, is a key driver of mitochondrial physiology. We previously developed a system to localize voltage-sensitive fluorophores to mitochondria based on the hydrolysis of labile acetoxymethyl (AM) esters. One potential problem with this system is the premature hydrolysis of the labile AM ester prior to accumulation in the mitochondria. A possible solution is to replace the AM ester with a bulky cyclopropylmethylacetoxy (CPM) ester, which resists uncatalyzed hydrolysis but can be removed by certain esterases. When paired with exogenous expression of mitochondrially-targeted esterases like porcine liver esterase (PLE), this chemical-genetic hybrid approach can improve localization to mitochondria. In this manuscript, we use superresolution microscopy to show that a variety of proteins, including esterases from pig and bacteria can be effectively localized to mitochondria. Further, we establish that a CPM-modified rhodamine voltage reporter (RhoVR-CPM) shows improved localization to mitochondria in cells expressing mitochondrially-targeted esterases. Finally, RhoVR-CPM can be paired with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to map changes in mitochondrial membrane potential.

It is generally understood to exhibit a high- and a low-conductance state in break junction experiments which are attributed to a tilted and stretched configuration of a single molecule. Despite this established view, we suggest a supramolecular origin for these conductance states that has not previously been considered. Our findings indicate that the high- and low-conductance states may arise from the presence of two molecules and one molecule, respectively, challenging the conventional interpretation. Using a state-of-the-art machine learning force field called the neuroevolution potential, we observe that the existing interpretation of a tilted and stretched configuration is inconsistent with our simulations. Instead, we propose that the existence of two molecules alters the geometry in the junction such that the conductance of the high-conductance state is more than twice that of the low-conductance state. Furthermore, we compare this interpretation to the existing literature of diverse experimental data on 4,4\u2019-bipyridine in break junctions and find that it is consistent with the broader body of experimental evidence.

Acenes with substitution on terminal and central rings were explored, with heteroatoms on the central ring being cleaved in the reaction.  Mechanistic experiments include deuterium labeling, reaction time course monitoring, radical trap experiments, and control experiments.  We observed that water is a necessary additive for the reduction using pure BI3.  Anhydrous HI was found to be insufficient to reduce acenes under these conditions, with or without BI3; however, HI formation was observed and subsequently consumed at rates that indicate its involvement in product formation. Ultimately, experimental evidence suggests that either a BI3\u2022OH2 adduct protonates the acene to initiate the reaction, or a hydrolysis product of BI3 catalyzes HI addition to the acene.

The material offers a maximum removal capacity of 106 mg/g, which is approximately 10 times higher than that of the bare MOF Fe-BTC (9.8 mg/g) at pH 3.

From a mechanistic point of view, MAGL metabolizes the most common endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), and additionally influences inflammatory signaling pathways by releasing arachidonic acid (AA). As of now, the therapeutic potential of MAGL has primarily been evaluated through the use of inhibitors and genetic knockout models. Herein, we describe the development of the first reversible MAGL proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs). PROTAC degradation efficiency was dependent on the nature of the linker and E3-ligase system used.  Cell permeability was proposed as a main limiting factor for their target engagement and degradation efficacy due to the excessive size and polarity of PROTAC conjugates. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed a chameleon-like behavior allowing the molecule to hide polar groups by forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds, showing environment-dependent lipophilicity. The best-performing reversible MAGL-PROTAC 4 is permeable, highly efficient with a DC50 < 1.0 nM, and specific in a relevant glioblastoma cell line, which was demonstrated by lipidomic and proteomic analysis. This PROTAC platform enables pharmacological silencing of both MAGLs\u2019 catalytic and potentially elusive structural functions without impacting other proteins.

They are composed of organic monomers stitched together by covalent bonds into highly ordered two- or three-dimensional architectures. The majority of the studies on two dimensional COFs have focused on eclipsed rather than antiparallel stacked structures. Drawing inspiration from non-covalent bonding motifs in biomolecules, we report the design and synthesis of robust two-dimensional (2D) COFs with amide side chains called aCOFamide-1 and -2, which mimic the hydrogen bonding motifs found in \u03b2-sheets.  These linker-based sidechains adopt an antiparallel stacked configuration to create binding sites that display excellent iodine adsorption capability (5.9 g/g and 6.7 g/g for I2 in aCOFamide-1 and -2, respectively).  The antiparallel stacked layers of aCOFamides form three-dimensional, multi-N, nanotraps, which can also bind and adsorb anions such as iodide (I-) in aqueous environments, a major challenge in molecular recognition. Computational electrostatic maps reveal localized regions of positive electrostatic potential near the amide functional groups in the aCOFamide, which enhances the iodide uptake up to 1.3 g/g and 1.7 g/g in aCOFamide-1 and -2, respectively. We also show that the crystalline nature of COFs plays a major role in adsorption capability, when compared to an porous organic polymer (POP) composed of monomers containing the same amide sidechains but is polymerized under kinetic control which produces an amorphous network with lower adsorption performance.

In order to expand the range of high-performance phenolic fluorophores usable as effective analytical molecular tools, we have explored the synthesis of a rigidified analog of flexible Brooker's merocyanine popularized by Eastman-Kodak company in the 1950s. We had the idea of applying a rigidification approach previously devised to assemble conformationally restrained polymethine indocyanine dyes. Thus, the implementation of an efficient acid-catalyzed domino double cyclization process allowed the synthesis of unprecedented fluorescent phenol KR306. A comprehensive photophysical study has highlighted its outstanding optical properties in neutral aq. buffered conditions; a brightness of 71 500 M-1 cm-1 at pH 7.5 for a yellow emission centered at ca. 560 nm, was obtained in particular. As with more traditional phenolic fluorophores, the hydroxyl group of KR306 can be modified to easily regulate its fluorescence properties.

Through the imple- mentation of virtual cluster moves in this framework, we mitigate unphysical energy traps and account for size-dependent diffusion of particles and their clusters. We find that the analytical potentials allow us to simulate NP assembly orders of magnitude faster than atomistic and coarse-grained models while yielding assembly morphologies closely resembling those from atomistic simulations. In contrast, coarse-grained mod- els of the NPs fail to capture the expected morphologies. Additionally, we explore the phase behavior of faceted NPs of varying shapes under weak and strong interactions, marking one of the first attempts at studying the phase diagram of attractive faceted particles. Our analysis reveals that, compared to hard-core potentials, attractive inter- actions enhance the ordering of particles in their assemblies. Specifically, they shift the transitions between isotropic and semiordered phases to lower volume fractions, but have little effect on the transition between semiordered and crystalline phases, which are primarily driven by entropy. Overall, our results offer new insights into the role of interparticle attraction in the phase behavior of faceted NPs, and emphasize the ad- vantages of our analytical potential over traditional hard-core potentials by accounting for enthalpic interactions between NPs.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Nanofabrication; Self-Assembly", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Electrochemical sensors have been identified as promising tools, particularly for field-deployable applications. However, conventional electrochemical sensing is inherently restricted to species that participate in redox reactions and are often single use, limiting its scope. In this study, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is presented as a promising alternative for ion detection, utilizing physico-chemical interactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. A first-principles model was developed to describe the impedance behavior of electrochemical interfaces, demonstrating how ion-specific interfacial processes influence electrochemical response. Based on this framework, an extensive EIS dataset was compiled, and an AI-assisted model was trained to predict electrolyte composition with high accuracy, achieving detection limits in the parts-per-billion (ppb) range. The findings indicate that EIS has significant potential as a complementary method for ion sensing, providing a novel perspective on selectivity and sensitivity beyond traditional electrochemical approaches. It is anticipated that this work will serve as a foundation for more advanced models of impedance behavior and EIS interpretation, as well as for the development of next-generation impedance-based sensors with broader applicability in complex environments, including biological fluids and industrial liquids.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Electrochemical Analysis; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Interfaces", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). UV-visible analysis confirmed nanoparticle formation through a characteristic absorption peak at 393 nm with 13.85% intensity. TEM micrographs revealed predominantly spherical and aggregated ZnONPs with an average size of 93 nm. EDS analysis confirmed the presence of elemental zinc through distinct peaks at 1.0, 8.8, and 9.8 keV. FTIR spectra identified a prominent O\u2013H stretching vibration at 3493 cm\u207b\u00b9, indicating the presence of polyphenolic compounds involved in nanoparticle stabilization.  The antimicrobial activity of both ZnONPs and doped ZnO/AgNPs was evaluated via agar well diffusion assays against clinical strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The doped nanoparticles demonstrated enhanced and species-selective antimicrobial effects, particularly against S. pyogenes, suggesting possible differential mechanisms of bacterial inhibition. This research highlights the viability of Senna occidentalis-mediated biosynthesis of ZnONPs as a scalable, eco-conscious approach to nanoparticle production.  In addition to the antimicrobial results, the biosynthesis route employed here aligns with the principles of green chemistry, eliminating the need for hazardous reducing agents and minimizing energy consumption. The rich phytochemical profile of S. occidentalis, including flavonoids, tannins, saponins, and phenolic acids, not only facilitates the reduction of zinc salts into ZnONPs but also contributes to the stabilization and capping of the nanoparticles, enhancing their colloidal stability and bioactivity. Furthermore, doping ZnONPs with silver particles resulted in synergistic effects, likely due to the combined mechanisms of reactive oxygen species generation, membrane disruption, and interference with essential metabolic pathways in bacteria.  The observed enhanced antimicrobial effect of doped ZnO/AgNPs over pure ZnONPs may also be attributed to improved surface reactivity and increased particle\u2013cell contact, which can accelerate bacterial cell wall penetration. Considering the urgent need for alternative antimicrobial strategies, such biosynthesized nanomaterials offer a sustainable route toward developing next-generation therapeutics. Future studies should also focus on shelf-life assessment, scalability trials, and potential integration with other natural biocidal agents to broaden their application scope in medical, agricultural, and environmental sectors.  The eco-friendly synthesis described in this work presents several advantages over conventional chemical and physical methods of nanoparticle production. By harnessing the phytochemical constituents of S. occidentalis, the process achieves dual functionality\u2014acting both as a reducing and capping agent\u2014while avoiding toxic solvents or high-energy inputs. This approach not only reduces the overall cost but also minimizes potential environmental hazards. Moreover, the resulting ZnONPs and ZnO/AgNPs exhibit promising bioactivity that can be tailored for specific therapeutic applications through controlled synthesis parameters. Such versatility enhances their potential use in topical antimicrobial formulations, medical device coatings, and targeted drug delivery systems. In addition, their biocompatibility, once validated through in vitro and in vivo studies, could support broader applications in regenerative medicine. Overall, these findings contribute to advancing sustainable nanotechnology in addressing the growing problem of multidrug-resistant infections.

Herein, we elucidate the modulation of optoelectronic properties and electronic conductivities of Blatter radicals functionalized with varied conjugating units in two-terminal solid-state devices. The 7-bromo-Blatter radical (4N\u2022) was stable under Pd(0)-catalyzed C-C coupling conditions and yielded 1N\u2022, 2N\u2022, and 3N\u2022, incorporating phenanthrene, ethynylphenanthrene, and naphthyl substituents at the C7-position, respectively. The radicals 1N\u2022 to 3N\u2022 exhibited bathochromically shifted absorption properties, reduced optical band gaps (ca. 2.13 eV) relative to 4N\u2022 (2.30 eV) due to enhanced \u03c0-delocalization. Upon one-electron oxidation (nN\u2022 \u2192 nN+), additional red-shifted absorption bands were observed, corroborated by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. Intermolecular \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions between 1,2,4-benzotriazine units facilitated intermolecular spin-spin interactions and strong antiferromagnetic interactions with 2J/kB values of \u221235.22 K and \u221223.73 K, for 1N\u2022 and 4N\u2022, respectively. Notably, the extended \u03c0-conjugation in 1N\u2022 and 2N\u2022 led to reduced band gaps and an order-of-magnitude increase in electronic conductivity (7.5\u00d710\u22126 S m\u22121) compared to 4N\u2022 (1\u00d710\u22127 S m\u22121).

Light is a promising energy source for driving active transport due to its precise spatiotemporal control, high selectivity, and operation with-out waste accumulation. Yet only few examples of light-driven active transport have been reported: these systems rely on specific host-guest interactions, which enable the transport of one particular species in each case.

Positively charged azobenzene derivatives act as light-responsive carriers, and their pho-toisomerization is coupled to transport across a liquid membrane by a molecular ratchet mechanism. Notably, their transport drives active transport of negatively charged cargos by forming ion pairs. This system can transport various anions which are simply added as salt, and it functions even in buffered solutions.

Meraz; Pratyush  Tiwary", "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been widely applied to investigate various physical and chemical processes in aqueous and interfacial environments, which are crucial for the design of energy materials and for understanding several chemical processes at the heart of life itself. However, the applicability of MD simulations has been constrained by several inherent challenges, including the accuracy of force fields, limitations in simulation size and timescales. One promising solution to these challenges is the integration of machine learning (ML) methods, both for improved description of the nature of interactions in aqueous systems as well as for enhanced sampling. In this review, we discuss the principles, implementation, and applications of ML force fields (MLFFs) and ML enhanced sampling methods to the study of aqueous, interfacial systems. We discuss five key categories of applications that use MLFFs, ML-enhanced sampling, and ML-driven data analytics. We first discuss how MLFFs are enabling quantum level accuracy at classical level cost for large scale simulations of complex aqueous and interfacial systems, and then highlight how coupling them with enhanced sampling and advanced data analytics, especially graph based approaches for featurizing such systems, can be used both for enhancing simulations and for understanding them by yielding reliable low dimensional reaction coordinates that improve the interpretation of high dimensional MD data. The discussed applications include investigations into the structure and dynamics of bulk water and aqueous interfaces, proton transfer, catalysis, phase transitions, and the prediction of vibrational spectra. In each case, we highlight how ML-based methods enable simulations that were previously computationally prohibitive and provide new physical insights into aqueous solutions and interfaces. For instance, MLFFs allow nanosecond-scale simulations with thousands of atoms while maintaining quantum chemistry accuracy. Additionally, ML-enhanced sampling facilitates the crossing of large reaction barriers and enables the exploration of extensive configuration spaces. Moreover, ML models trained on simulation data uncover previously overlooked factors, such as the role of solvent dynamics in phase transitions. The combination of MLFFs with enhanced sampling techniques makes the calculation of high-dimensional free energy surfaces feasible, significantly improving our understanding of chemical reactions. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in this field and outline potential future research directions to further advance the integration of ML in MD simulations.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This study investigates the risk of long-term real-world PM2.5 exposure in liver disease progression through a developed digital rodent liver model utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques. Shotgun mass spectrometry (MS) imaging data were acquired from mouse liver disease models across a continuum of fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC for training a multi-class classification model to identify \u201cNo Risk\u201d, \u201cCancer Risk\u201d, and \u201cCancer\u201d.

However, the existing examples of topochemical polymerization relies on the formation of strong covalent bonds (e.g. C-C, C-N and C-O), while the construction of single-crystalline polymers based on weak yet dynamic covalent bond, e.g. disulfide bonds, remains elusive. Here we report a single-crystalline poly(disulfide) by photo-triggered topochemical ring-opening polymerization of an 1,2-dithiolane mediated by disulfide exchange. The key design is to control the spatial distance and geometry of 1,2-dithiolane ring by elaborating sidechain H-bonding moieties that determines the supramolecular self-assembling architecture of monomeric crys-tals.

Screening of our aminopeptidase-reactive fluorescence probe library with lysates of metastatic tissues from rectal cancer identified a specifically activated puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA)-reactive probe.

Our DFT modeling reproduces the geometric parameters of \u03b1-poly-Ala with near-experimental accuracy, maps the \u03b1\u27f6\u03c0 transition as a first-order phase transition, and identifies (Met-Ala)\u2099 \u03c0-helices as the preferred matrices for canonical Pd(II) Suzuki coupling intermediates. In contrast, Pd incorporation in the \u03b1-helical matrix poses significant challenges, as shown by relaxed potential energy scans. From the periodic \u03c0-helix, we extract a cluster containing over 250 atoms and model it in aqueous solution at the \u03c9B97X-V/def2-TZVP-gCP level to obtain reliable energetics for the free energy profile of the key oxidative addition step. The profile featured a low activation barrier and exergonic product formation, with reaction energy falling within the optimal window and barriers lower than those reported for bis-phosphine Pd(0) complexes. This methodology offers an efficient strategy for the de novo design of peptides and environmentally benign bioinorganic catalysts, from sequence to the reactivity of the metal center.", "date": "2025-08-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Bioorganometallic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

But a clear understanding of why ORR rates respond more strongly to pH over certain catalysts than others has not been developed. Here, we propose that pH effects on the ORR result from electric field induced changes in the binding energies of intermediates involved in kinetically relevant elementary steps. For strongly binding metals (Pt, Ir, Ru, Pd), whose rates are limited by the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) step to form *OOH or remove adsorbed OH (*OH), ORR rates are weakly affected by electrolyte pH. This behavior is observed because the binding energies of the reaction intermediates in these steps are minimally affected by electric field strength. The weak pH dependence is most pronounced for Pt, which shows essentially identical rates in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. For weakly binding metals (Au, Ag), whose rates are limited by non-PCET O2 adsorption, ORR rates increase significantly when moving from acidic to alkaline electrolytes. This strong pH dependence results from the stabilization of adsorbed O2 by the increasingly negative electric field present at the catalyst surface under alkaline conditions. We argue that modifying electrolyte pH does not change the rate-determining elementary step, but does decrease the apparent activation barrier for O2 adsorption over weakly binding catalysts. These arguments are substantiated by a combination of experimental kinetic studies and atomistic simulations.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This ongoing debate reflects a central tension: while some caution against overinterpreting unidentified signals lacking biological evidence, others argue that dismissing them too quickly risks overlooking genuine molecular discoveries. These discussions also raise a deeper question: what exactly should be considered part of the metabolome? As metabolomics advances toward large-scale data mining and high-throughput computational analysis, resolving these conceptual and methodological ambiguities has become essential. In this perspective, we propose a refined definition of the \u201cdark metabolome\u201d and present a systematic overview of ISFs and related ion forms, including adducts and multimers.

Under mildly acidic conditions, FeTPP\u2010based catalysts are selective towards the 2e\u2013/2H+ reduction of CO2 to CO; however, in the presence of more acidic proton donors, indiscriminate proton transfers often result in parasitic H2 evolution. This report investigates how SCS amide positioning alters CO versus H2 selectivity during CO2 reduction with a series of four FeTPP isomers bearing SCS amides at varying positions around the porphyrin core: NH donors are placed at either the meta or ortho position of the meso aryl porphyrin ring, as well as proximal (closer) or distal (farther away) to the porphyrin plane. In the presence of a conventional, weakly acidic proton source (phenol; pKa = 29.2 in MeCN), all isomers display the expected high Faradaic efficiency (FE) towards CO (FECO = 67\u201385%) along with minimal H2 evolution (FEH2 = 3\u201313%). With a significantly stronger acid (3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) phenol; pKa = 23.8 in MeCN), H2 becomes the major product when using the ortho-distal or both meta isomers (FEH2 = 45\u201365%) as well as unfunctionalized FeTPP (FEH2 = 78%). Importantly, the ortho-proximal isomer shows dramatically rescued CO selectivity under these unconventionally acidic conditions (FECO = 83 \u00b1 4%).

The Echo\u00ae MS+ system, an advanced acoustic ejection (AE) system coupled with a mass spectrometer (MS), offers a genuinely high-throughput, contactless workflow for comprehensive lipid profiling.  In this study, we developed an automated high-throughput workflow based on a single-phase lipid extraction using 1-octanol, and methanol with 10mM ammonium formate as a carrier solvent, to measure lipid profiles covering 10 lipid classes, namely, phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, sphingomyelin, cholesteryl ester and cholesterol from plasma samples. We optimized sample preparation protocols, solvent systems, and droplet ejection parameters to maintain sensitivity and minimize variability of lipid signals. The extraction recoveries for lipid class representatives, typically between 89% and 95%, were found to be comparable to those obtained with the traditional butanol/methanol extraction method.  We also tested the extract integrity; 1-octanol extracts did not show any degradation of lipids after the storage for several days. We assessed the fast analysis AE-MS mode, operating at a speed of 4 seconds per sample, for the quantitation of targeted lipid panels. The signal reproducibility for the lipid class representatives was better than 6% and the linear response was confirmed across 2 orders of magnitude. The semi-quantitative profile from AE-MS analysis of a target panel of 14 ceramides in NIST SRM 1950 was consistent with the published data. Additionally, we investigated a 9-second-wide peak AE-MS mode, operating at a speed of 12 seconds per sample, for its utility in untargeted qualitative lipid analysis. We employed the data dependent high-resolution (HR) MS acquisition. Data analysis of plasma extracts involved a search for the 14 most common plasma lipid classes, and it resulted in a comprehensive lipid profile, consistently identifying  200 most abundant lipid molecular ions per polarity in all samples in 384-well plate; a total of 338 lipid were reported as sum compositions. The MS information was supplemented with lipid structure details and tentative molecular species assignments based on the corresponding MS/MS data. For example, 42 major PC lipids measured in HR MS were found to correspond to 69 PC molecular species. This new technique, combining the single-phase 1-octanol plasma extraction with AE-MS analysis offers a carryover-free workflow, enabling ultra-fast comprehensive lipid measurements using small nanolitre extracts and minimal solvent volumes.

Over 90 years of research, its manifestations in numerous processes were observed (also in the form of Gibbs energy (\u0394G) vs. enthalpy correlations), and much attention was paid to its origin. It is commonly accepted that the linear \u0394H vs. \u0394S correlations hold as long as the same interaction type or mechanism operates throughout. This saves space for using the compensation plots to characterize narrow series of processes but reduces its predictive capability in the general case.\nIn this work, we applied Hess\u2019s law to derive the relationship between \u0394G and \u0394H of gas-phase molecular complexation based on our previous studies of the compensation effect in solvation thermodynamics. This relation was then checked against the experimental data on 67 complexes in the \u0394H range up to 70 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121. The scarce experimental data were supplemented with computations of the binding enthalpies of each complex using the coupled cluster method with complete basis set extrapolation. The root-mean-square deviation between the ab initio computed binding enthalpies and the values predicted from the experimental Gibbs energies was 2.7 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121. \n\u0394G and \u0394H of both collective and pairwise interactions governed by van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, and charge transfer appear to obey a common relationship, which might also be applicable in more complex processes, e.g., supramolecular recognition.

It is well established that electric fields influence the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of cells along with re-epithelialization and vascularization of wounds.

This instability makes the synthesis of functionalized bicyclo[n.1.1]alkanes from protic nucleophiles by electrophilic activation of [n.1.1]propellanes particularly challenging. In stark contrast, we now report a four-component reaction between [n.1.1]propellanes (n = 1 or 3), N-iodosuccinimide, nine cyclic ethers and ten classes of protic nucleophiles, that maintains the structural integrity of the bicyclo[n.1.1]alkyl motif in the products. Crucially, this reaction gives one-step access to 4-hydroxy thalidomide derivatives that enabled us to demonstrate in a whole cell assay that a n-butoxy-bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl linker is tolerated by cereblon, a component of E3 ligase, which is an important target of proteolysis-targeting chimeras. Experimental rate law and theoretical calculations with a model nucleophile suggest that the four-component reaction relies on the attack by THF of a halogen bond complex formed between N-iodosuccinimide and the propellane, which is assisted by hydrogen bonding of the protic nucleophiles to the succinimide component.", "date": "2025-08-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, existing frameworks cannot account for why even nonpolar, non-faradaic reactions are sensitive to interfacial polarization. In order to uncover the molecular basis of this phenomenon, we herein study the potential-dependent reaction kinetics of ethylene and trans-2-butene hydrogenation at Pt-liquid interfaces. Measurements were performed in aqueous and ortho-difluorobenzene (o-DFB) solutions, spontaneously polarizing the Pt-liquid interfaces by respectively varying the pH or dissolving distinct metallocene redox buffers into solution. We find that, at comparable mechanistic regimes, the rates of both ethylene and trans-2-butene hydrogenation are maximized near the same electrochemical potential, E. Moreover, the potential-dependence, defined as as \u2202 ln\u2061r/\u2202E, of trans-2-butene hydrogenation is approximately 2.2x greater than that of ethylene hydrogenation across the full potential range studied. These observations are all consistent with a model in which polarization of the Pt surface away from the local potential of zero free charge (E_PZFC) induces electrostatic organization of polar solvent and/or charged ions near the interface, which impedes olefin adsorption and surface reaction because these surface reactions induce electrolyte displacement. Accordingly, interfacial polarization alters the free energy landscape and thus rate of nonpolar heterogeneous catalysis by controlling the degree of electrostatic organization of polar and charged spectators at the interface, which do not in general need to be specifically chemisorbed onto the surface, but could simply be close enough to the surface to be perturbed by the olefin adsorption.

Aluminum metal offers a safer, more sustainable alternative to magnesium, as it is abundant from scrap sources and easily recycled. However, existing aluminothermic reduction methods typically require AlCl3 salt, which is volatile, difficult to recycle, and demands long reaction times.

Understanding the redox activity of Cu in O3-type Na\u2093TMO\u2082 materials is crucial, as it could directly influence the charge compensation mechanism, voltage profile, and structural stability.

In the same way that chemists interpret visual indicators to identify promising samples, computer vision (CV) is an efficient approach to accelerate materials characterization across varying scales when visual cues are present. CV is particularly useful in high-throughput\nsynthesis and characterization workflows, as these techniques can be rapid, scalable, and cost-effective.

These alloys are often sought-after due to their exceptional mechanical properties, such as high hardness, strength, and thermal stability, which make them highly desirable for various applications. However, a significant challenge in the discovery and design of MPEAs lies in the vast and complex compositional space they occupy, which is both high-dimensional and sparsely explored. Traditional methods for identifying MPEAs with desirable properties tend to rely heavily on trial-and-error experimentation, which is time-consuming and inefficient. In this work, we apply an active learning approach, PAL 2.0, utilizing Bayesian optimization to significantly accelerate the discovery of MPEAs with high hardness.[1] PAL 2.0 operates in a closed-loop framework, closely integrating physics-based Gaussian process models with experi- mental validation. Our methodology enables the model to intelligently navigate the compositional space and make informed decisions about the most promising alloys to synthesize and test. Based on recommendations made by PAL 2.0, we successfully synthesized 20 new MPEAs through a rapid arc-melting process.[2] Among these, we identified two alloys with exceptionally high Vickers hardness values of 1269 and 1263. While the original training dataset had only three MPEAs with hardness above 1000, our method recognized five additional compositions with a hardness over 1000, thereby doubling the number of very hard MPEAs. The most striking discovery is the appearance of silicon and tantalum together in the alloys, a combination not seen in any high hardness alloy within the training dataset. Our study demonstrates the power of PAL 2.0 as a fast, efficient, and scalable tool for the discovery of materials with optimal properties, significantly reducing the parameter space for promising new materials candidates. This work not only accelerates the development of high-performance MPEAs but, since PAL\u2019s use is materials-agnostic, it offers a pathway to explore other complex, high-dimensional material spaces, paving the way for future advancements in materials science.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Alloys", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we demonstrate the universality of this descriptor to rationalize the observation or absence of cation effects across a range of reactions (the hydrogen evolution reaction, the ORR, methanol oxidation, ethylene glycol oxidation, and glycerol oxidation) and metal surfaces (Pt, Pd, Ag, and Au). We argue that when the reaction's operating potential is negative of the metal's PZTC, electrolyte cations accumulate at the catalyst surface and influence reaction rates.

Quorum sensing (QS) systems\u2014microbial communication mechanisms that regulate gene expression based on population density\u2014are known to be more active in biofilm-associated bacteria than in planktonic cells. We hypothesize that bacteria dispersed from biofilms in DWDS influence QS-related mRNA levels in tap water effluent. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common DWDS bacterium, as a model organism, we examined the expression of the lasI gene, a key component of the las QS system responsible for synthesizing QS signaling molecules. Specifically, the transcriptional activity of lasI was systematically analyzed in both planktonic and biofilm-associated bacteria and was found to be especially elevated at the biofilm surface, where dispersion primarily occurs. Additionally, we quantified lasI mRNA in effluent under two conditions known to trigger biofilm dispersion: (1) low free chlorine levels combined with extended stagnation, and (2) transitions to oligotrophic water quality. These experiments support that biofilm growth and dispersion in DWDS can be accurately and non-invasively monitored by analyzing lasI mRNA in the effluent.

Variable-temperature X-ray diffraction with coupled mass spectrometry shows that the fluorinated phases of both active materials release oxygen after oxidative fluorination using AgF. Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry revealed that significant CO2, CO and NO evolution takes place during electrochemical fluorination, but O2 evolution could not be detected. Consequently, the gas evolution observed does not compromise the long-term stability of the cell performance. Variable-temperature X-ray diffraction of the charged cathode composites reveals that the electrochemically fluorinated products decompose once heated beyond 300 \u00b0C, then undergoing similar phase evolution behavior as observed in chemical fluorination.

The cleaning procedure consisted of a high-pressure H2-treatment and subsequent sputtering and annealing in vacuum at ~ 650 \u00b0C to obtain clean LEED images. Clean (1x1) patterns were recorded for Fe(100), Fe(111) and Fe(110). Before undergoing high-pressure H2-treatment, impurities in Fe(100) and Fe(111) present faceted surfaces, whereas Fe(110) shows complex overstructures. Further confirmation for successful reduction is given by XPS results. Fe2p3/2 is shown to be at 706.7 eV. Moreover, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was employed for valence band and work function measurements.

However, written instruction in the interpretation of NMR spectra of peptides and proteins is generally focused on advanced techniques and highly complex spectra, with a lack of simple spectra and guides available for beginning students. In order to address this instructional limitation, we have generated a dataset of 1H NMR spectra of a series of simple peptides that include all canonical amino acids. Peptides examined include Ac-X(S/pS)-NH2, Ac-X(T/pT)-NH2, and Ac-XPPGY-NH2, where X = all encoded amino acids, pS = phosphorylated Ser, and pT = phosphorylated Thr. The characterization of each peptide includes a 1-D spectrum and a TOCSY spectrum, with both the raw and processed data available. The spectra can be used for instructional applications, including analysis of regions of the spectra (e.g. amide HN, aromatic, H, and aliphatic regions); identification of spin systems and residue assignment via TOCSY spectra; analysis of conformational features including amide HN chemical shift dispersion and changes due to hydrogen bonding or post-translational modifications; the 3JN coupling constant that reports on the  torsion angle and on order versus disorder at a given residue; conformational preferences at H via chemical shift index analysis; understanding of diastereotopic hydrogens; dynamic processes, including hydrogen exchange; and identification of proline cis-trans isomerism. In addition, for a limited number of peptides, NOESY spectra are included to allow sequential resonance assignment and for assignment of trans versus cis proline conformations. Spectra from closely related peptides allow the analysis of the relative effects of single amino acid changes. The paper is written to be directly accessible to students as a tutorial guide. In addition, the data can be used by instructors for problem sets and exams.

The photothermal effect has traditionally been studied at room temperature, but apart from expanding the scope of samples, there was an open question whether the signal itself would benefit from a lower temperature, as the photoinduced heating could be more localized, thus increasing the signal. To enable such measurements, a temperature- controlled stage was fitted into the O-PTIR microscope to evaluate the O-PTIR signal of tristearin, biological tissue and polymers during temperature lowering from room temperature down to -100 \u00b0C. Therefore, we report the first successful temperature-controlled spectroscopic measurements and imaging of samples at subzero temperatures using O-PTIR. Moreover, for the first time, we observed an up to 3 times increase in O-PTIR signal with decreasing temperature, with a maximum in the -20 to -40 \u00b0C range.

However, over the course of cycling, they experience rapid capacity decay when cycled above 4.2 V (vs Li/Li+) through bulk and surface mediated instabilities. Surface engineering via ultrathin aluminium oxide (AlxOy) coatings has the potential to provide an effective approach to inhibit the surface degradation pathways in LNO, but their long-term benefits remain unclear. Further, it is not well understood whether AlxOy coatings can provide any surface-to-bulk stabilisation effects. Here, we employ an ultrathin and conformal film of AlxOy on polycrystalline LNO powder via a scalable powder atomic layer deposition (ALD) method. Electrochemical performance was evaluated in high-mass-loading pouch cells (LNO vs. graphite) in a voltage window of 3.0\u20134.1 V using a constant-current constant-voltage (CCCV) protocol. Cells containing the ALD-coated LNO cathodes demonstrated significantly improved capacity retention (91.2%) over 100 cycles at a C/3 rate. In-house operando X-ray diffraction data on pouch cells demonstrated that after aging, ALD-coated LNO showed less kinetically hindered delithiation as compared to the uncoated LNO, confirming a surface-to-bulk effect. Postmortem surface-sensitive spectroscopy showed both the HF scavenging role of the AlxOy coatings and suppression of dense surface reconstructions in coated LNO. These findings highlight the efficacy of our scalable surface engineering approach in mitigating interfacial degradation, reducing impedance growth and improving bulk delithiation kinetics, which enhances the long-term electrochemical performance of these ultra-Ni-rich cathode materials.", "date": "2025-08-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

This study investigated the chlorination of BTR and identified 1-chlorobenzotriazole (1-Cl BTR) as the primary chlorination product, formed preferentially under near-neutral to acidic pH and excess chlorine\u2014conditions typically found in water disinfection. The DBP formation potential of 1-Cl BTR was evaluated using Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA), natural organic matter (SRNOM), and secondary wastewater effluents (SWE), and compared against hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and monochloramine (NH2Cl). Surprisingly, 1-Cl BTR formed DBP levels comparable or greater than those from HOCl, including trihalomethanes, haloaldehydes, haloketones, haloacetonitriles and halonitromethanes. This unexpected reactivity is attributed to 1-Cl BTR\u2019s unique ability to function as a free chlorine reservoir, sustaining chlorination reactions over time and promoting elevated DBP formation\u2014unlike typical N-halamines. DBP speciation trends with 1-Cl BTR were strongly pH-dependent and consistent with those observed for HOCl, further supporting its role as a free chlorine reservoir. Additionally, 1-Cl BTR exhibited precursor- and matrix-dependent reactivity, especially with complex matrices like SWE, where it acted both as a chlorine source and direct DBP precursor. This work presents the first detailed evaluation of 1-Cl BTR\u2019s DBP formation potential, revealing an overlooked pathway for halogenated DBP production in water disinfection.

One of the biggest challenges is that these datasets are mostly generated at different quantum chemical (QC) levels. However, a general framework scalable to learning across both chemical space and quantum chemical levels remains in need. In this work, we proposed the all-in-one approach that enables simultaneous learning on an arbitrary number of QC levels from various datasets, presenting a more general and easier-to-use alternative to transfer learning. We showcase the superiority of our all-in-one strategy by creating OMNI-P1 \u2013 the first-ever universal interatomic potential simultaneously learning and making predictions at different QC levels. The generalization capability of the universal model OMNI-P1 for organic molecules is comparable to semi-empirical GFN2-xTB and common density functional theory (DFT) methods with a double-\u03b6 basis set, while the speed is orders of magnitude faster. Due to its unique ability to make predictions at different levels, a single model trained with our approach provides a straightforward way to also generate the corrections. This can be used in the \u0394-learning models without the need to train a dedicated correcting model.

These clusters dynamically evolve across their potential energy landscape, adopting triangular, elongated two-point, single-point, and more spherical configurations often with distinct conical surface protrusions. The manifestation of this instability differs from that observed in mesoscopic and microscopic droplets containing macroions, where stable ``star-like'' structures form, characterized by a specific number of conical protrusions that varies with the droplet size. We find that the orientation of the \\ce{H2O} molecules surrounding the metal ion is influenced not only by the electric field of the trivalent ion but also by the local conical protrusions. To further investigate the local acidity in the conical protrusions, a model system consisting of an aqueous nano-cluster containing three \\ce{H3O+} ions was simulated using ab initio molecular dynamics. Within the conical regions of the cluster, protons exhibit mobility across several water molecules forming cyclic structures, in contrast to the more localized proton delocalization observed in the compact body of the cluster. These findings suggest that local geometry can significantly modulate acidity in highly charged nano-clusters, with potential implications for understanding charge-transfer and ionization mechanisms in techniques such as electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.

Photo-affinity label-ing (PAL) utilizes photoreactive molecules that derivatize solvent-accessible sites in the target protein and the prod-ucts of this reaction can be used to deduce conformational information. In this work, we devised a novel oxidation process instigated by UV irradiation of aromatic diazirines. We initially explored the labeling of the peptides ACTH (1-14) and melittin. In both cases, a highly selective oxidation occurred only on methionine (Met) and tryptophan (Trp). PAL on ubiquitin, followed by top-down MS sequencing, also confirmed the oxidation on the single methio-nine. The optimum condition for the diazirine-promoted oxidation (DPO) was using 4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]benzoic acid (TDBA) as a diazirine precursor with short UV irradiation of 2 minutes. To assess whether this labeling could be utilized to evaluate protein conformation, we conducted differential PAL studies between na-tive and urea-denatured forms of ubiquitin and cytochrome c, as well as holo- and apo-myoglobin. Oxidative labeling could not distinguish between native and denatured states of ubiquitin, likely due to only subtle changes in solvent accessibility of the methionine residue. In contrast, this technique successfully distinguished each conformation of cytochrome c and myoglobin with p < 0.05 and p < 0.005, respectively. Bottom-up MS analyses also provided residue-level information. The oxidative labeling also successfully probed the burial of Trp60 in the early stage of amyloid forming. This novel oxidative labeling is highly promising when combined with well-known carbene labeling.

The separation of montebrasite from spodumene\u2014the primary lithium ore mineral\u2014commonly by flotation, is necessary for effective downstream lithium extraction. Understanding how water molecules interact with the montebrasite surface is necessary to understand its separation from other minerals by flotation. This study examined the interaction between water and montebrasite using dissolution tests, surface charge analysis, and various spectroscopic techniques (UV, FTIR, XPS, and XANES), all supported by density functional theory calculations. We found evidence of amphoteric properties (hydroxylation of surface Al and Li, and protonation of phosphate group) with acid-base reactions, F/OH ion exchange (-142.61 kcal/mol), non-stoichiometric dissolution (F > Li > Al > P), and dissociative chemisorption (-187.06 kcal/mol) at the mineral\u2013water interface. This surface reactivity could impact solution chemistry and influence collector adsorption on the mineral surface during flotation. Surface dissolution and ion exchange may lead to the release of Li to industrial process water, in addition to F, potentially forming LiF in solution. These findings are important in the froth flotation field because the change in solution pH caused by significant amounts of amphoteric minerals, such as montebrasite, can affect flotation results since flotation performance depends on pH, leading to unstable flotation circuits. However, this issue may be managed by achieving and/or maintaining an equilibrium pH through an appropriate conditioning stage. This work builds important knowledge of montebrasite surface properties and the montebrasite-water interface, essential to understanding many natural phenomena and engineering processes. Accordingly, we discussed the implications for montebrasite froth flotation, mineral alteration, environmental impact, and its potential as a promising functional material for heterogeneous catalysis and Li-ion batteries.\n", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Interfaces; Physical and Chemical Properties; Surface; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this work, we examine trace gas measurements from a central air monitoring station in Calgary, Alberta, Canada to attribute the city\u2019s CH4 emissions to major source categories. Using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), we identified four primary CH4 emissions source categories: natural gas \u2013 fugitives, natural gas \u2013 incomplete combustion, waste/biogenic, and petroleum product processing. Results from PMF modeling indicate that the bulk of the CH4 emissions in Calgary are from natural gas fugitives and incomplete combustion (81% \u00b1 35%). This is much higher than the proportion derived from available bottom-up emissions inventories. The CH4 emissions from natural gas sources increase in winter and may be related to increased natural gas use for space heating. Emissions from waste/biogenic sources were the next largest contributor, which doubled in warmer months, consistent with temperature-driven microbial activity. Though relatively small, CH4 emissions from petroleum product processing are non-negligible and consistent. Overall, these findings underscore the need for targeted mitigation strategies focused on the natural gas supply chain, while also highlighting the influence of seasonal dynamics on urban CH4 emissions.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Inspired by the impact of Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold in structural biology, this study presents a closed-loop generative AI framework for polymer inverse design. The starting dataset contained only SMILES representations of polymer repeat units. To enable property-targeted generation, 17 RDKit molecular descriptors were computed, while available experimental glass transition temperatures (Tg) and mass attenuation coefficients (MAC) were integrated. Since experimental coverage was sparse, random forest surrogate models were trained to predict Tg and MAC, filling in missing values and producing a fully annotated dataset. These predictors achieved high accuracy (R\u00b2 > 0.99 for MAC, R\u00b2 > 0.90 for Tg) and were then used in tandem with a property-conditional Transformer that generates chemically valid SMILES conditioned on target properties. Generated candidates were automatically featurized, evaluated by the surrogate models, and selected through a score\u2013diversity scheme that balances performance with novelty. The resulting closed-loop system enables iterative sampling, prediction, and refinement, accelerating the exploration of chemical space beyond what is feasible through experiment-driven discovery. This framework identifies polymers with Tg values near 215 \u00b0C and MAC above 0.0569 cm\u00b2/g, consistent with desired radiation shielding performance.

We elucidate a unified mechanistic framework for the reactions of DDQ and a diverse range of alkene substrates utilizing high-level computations and various experiments, including kinetics measurements, linear free energy relationships, and isotopic effects. Contrary to the prevailing SET paradigm, we demonstrate that these transformations are initialized by addition of DDQ to alkene. Critically, this addition operates on a mechanistic continuum between classical electrophilic addition (AdE2) and a newly recognized elementary step termed addition-coupled electron transfer (ACET). A zwitterionic intermediate is generated in the AdE2 regime while a biradical intermediate is in the ACET one by concurrent nucleophilic addition and electron transfer. The position of a reaction on the ACET-AdE2 continuum is governed by the electronic properties of alkene substrates and the extent of acid catalysis. By integrating high-level DLPNO-CCSD(T) and NEVPT2 calculations with multiple experimental probes, we provide a computational\u2013experimental dissection of these mechanisms with state-of-art accuracy. Although DDQ is the focus here, this unified framework is not restricted to DDQ: the ACET\u2013AdE2 continuum is likely general for a broad class of oxidants. Most importantly, this study deepens our understanding of ACET as a new elementary step in organic reactivity, using DDQ as a representative case.

In this article, we studied the solvation structure and thermodynamics around anionic and cationic functionalized gold nanoparticles by systematically varying the coverage through a combined molecular dynamics simulation (MD) and Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory (GIST) approach. Our results reveal that the cationic functional groups organize and pack themselves tightly around the metal surface as compared to anionic functional groups. There is a significant disruption of the tetrahedral hydrogen bond network of water under the confinement as well as the outer surface of the functionalized nanoparticle. The solute-water interactions are relatively stronger in the case of anionic functionalized GNPs than in the case of cationic counterparts. There is a significant gain in the free energy near the nanoparticle-water interface with an increase in coverage, this gain is markedly stronger in case of anionic GNPs compared to the cationic ones.  Although the gain in free energy is predominantly contributed by the solute-water energy, the contribution from the orientational entropy loss is notable.

One promising approach to tackling this challenge is the development of novel technologies capable of capturing CO2 and converting it into valuable chemicals such as ethylene (C2H4). Alkali hydroxide scrubbing captures CO2 as carbonate/bicarbonate-rich solutions; however, regenerating pure CO2 for vapour-fed CO2 electrolyzers is energy- and cost-intensive. (Bi)carbonate-fed electrolyzers circumvent these steps by directly converting the capture solution into valuable chemicals. Nevertheless, the activity and stability of state-of-the-art (bi)carbonate-fed electrolysis systems remain inferior to vapour-fed CO2 electrolyzers, necessitating the development of improved electrocatalysts, electrodes, and device designs. This research systematically explores nanostructured copper-based porous electrodes to improve the electrocatalytic conversion of (bi)carbonate to ethylene (C2H4), a compound of significant industrial importance. Specifically, we examine uniformly distributed polycrystalline copper nanowires grown on copper substrates, with nanowire size, density, and spatial distribution tuned via varied electrochemical oxidation protocols. Comprehensive morphological and structural characterization was conducted via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The best-performing electrodes demonstrated Faradaic efficiencies toward ethylene of ~37% at a current density of 150 mA cm\u22122 and a cell voltage of 3.3 V, and remained stable for at least 100 hours. Compared to previous state-of-the-art (bi)carbonate-fed electrolyzers with comparable stability, this system nearly doubles the energy efficiency toward ethylene production, reaching ~13%. To elucidate the mechanisms behind this performance boost, we employed operando high-speed optical microscopy combined with mass-transport numerical modeling, which revealed two complementary phenomena at play: (1) localized increase in pH within the nanowire array suppresses the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER); and (2) promotion of rapid bubble growth and detachment, due to the high aerophobicity of the electrode induced by Wenzel-state wettability, increases convective CO2 transport to the electrode surface and mitigates local CO2 depletion. Finally, our techno-economic analysis indicates that the (bi)carbonate-fed electrolyzer system becomes more cost-effective than vapour-fed CO2 electrolyzers when electricity prices exceed 2.6 \u00a2/kWh\u2014a threshold commonly surpassed in most regions worldwide.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

Two primary approaches have emerged as dominant methodologies: the traditional bioassay-guided isolation (BGI) and the more recent metabolomics-based discovery approaches. This comprehensive review critically compares these methodologies, including their principles, technical capabilities, strengths, limitations, and their applications in natural product discovery. While BGI has a long history as the gold standard, providing remarkable drugs such as artemisinin, paclitaxel, and vinblastine, metabolomics offers broad chemical coverage, sensitivity, and high throughput capabilities that can overcome the limitations of activity-driven approaches. To accelerate, improve the accuracy and ensure the success of natural product\u2013based research, selecting only one of the two approaches is not advisable. This review recommends combining both approaches to leverage the strengths of each while addressing their respective limitations, thereby enhancing the success of natural product drug discovery research. In this context, metabolomics provides accurate data for compound prioritization from the phytochemical complexity of NPs, whereas BGI delivers precise data for confirming active compounds and verifying bioactivity.

One way through which these structures can be formed is self-assembly (SA) in spherical confinement, and what makes them unique is that they combine the properties of the smaller particles with collective properties arising from the length scale on which these smaller particles are ordered. Additionally, the limited number of particles in a SP makes that they can form structures that are not found in bulk systems. An example of this is icosahedral symmetry, which is the equilibrium structure for SPs up to several hundreds of thousands of particles. Although these icosahedral structures have been investigated through computer simulations and several experimental techniques have been used to analyze them in 3D, the number of experimental datasets published is so limited that no statistically relevant conclusions have been drawn so far. The experimental technique most commonly applied to study them is scanning electron microscopy (SEM), but with this only quantitative information about the surface of the SPs can be obtained. By using a combination of 3D confocal and simulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy on extremely well index-matched (within 0.002) fluorescent core-shell, colloidal silica spheres (of 442-478 nm in diameter with polydispersities below 2 %), we obtained full 3D real-space datasets of tens of SPs within several hours. The structures were classified based on bond order parameters and the locations with respect to the center of mass, using an unsupervised machine learning model. From this we are able to correctly classify structures that are commonly misidentified using SEM.

Here we combine experiment and theory to demonstrate that ultrafast control over the vibronic dynamics involving a low-frequency mode in poly(3- hexylthiophene) is possible via a photoluminescence-detected chirp-dependent double-pump approach. By chirping one of the pump pulses, we show that the temporal ordering of resonant frequency components can be used to engineering the initial vibronic coherence induced in the system. Particularly, the spectro- scopic signals reveal distinct symmetry properties as a function of inter-pulse delay and chirp, i.e., delay and chirp can be used to manipulate quantum beats associated to the system\u2019s vibronic dynamics.

Current stabilization methods rely heavily on cold-chain logistics, which are expensive and challenging to maintain, particularly in resource-limited settings. To address these challenges, ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents have been explored as non-aqueous solvents for RNA extraction and preservation. However, most previously studied media contain toxic heavy metals or form ternary aqueous two-phase systems that do not protect against RNases. Moreover, model RNAs used in prior studies are simple and not representative of mRNAs. Here, we report the use of a simple, metal-free, hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent (hDES) composed of methyltrioctylammonium chloride and 1-decanol to extract and preserve mRNA at room temperature. Under optimized conditions, we achieve near 100% extraction efficiency into the protective hDES phase that effectively preserves mRNA integrity as assessed by capillary gel electrophoresis and an in vitro assay. We also demonstrate that this hDES system can extract complex mRNA strands of clinically relevant lengths and modifications. Importantly, the hDES phase also shields mRNA from RNase A exposure and suppresses hydrolytic degradation, enabling long-term preservation of mRNAs at room temperature for at least 227 days. Due to its ability to partition, preserve, and release mRNA, hDES composed of fatty alcohols and quaternary ammonium salts could be tailored for use as shelf-stable, non-aqueous precursors to RNA-based therapeutics such as cationic emulsions and lipid nanoparticles.

Disrupting these QS-regulated pathways is a promising anti-virulence strategy, as it interferes with bacterial communication without exerting selective pressure for resistance. In this study, the effect of Tagetes erecta extract on the inhibition of QS-dependent virulence factors was evaluated in three strains of P. aeruginosa: PaO1, Pa14, and ATCC 27853. The extract was tested at concentrations of 500, 750, and 1000 \u00b5g/mL, and its effect on pyocyanin and elastase production was quantified spectrophotometrically. The results showed that T. erecta extract produced strong inhibition of pyocyanin in all strains, with inhibition percentages greater than 95% even at the lowest concentration. This suggests a potent and early effect, likely independent of dose escalation. In contrast, elastase production showed more variable responses among strains, with apparent reductions in Pa14 and ATCC 27853 compared to PaO1, although without a clearly consistent pattern. These findings indicate that the extract of T. erecta may contain compounds capable of interfering with QS signaling, particularly in the inhibition of phenazine pigments such as pyocyanin. Further studies are needed to isolate and characterize the active phytocompounds involved, as well as to evaluate their effects in more complex biological systems.

To apply the concept to short, yet aggregation-prone sequences, some practical limitations need to be addressed: tag removal needs to be simplified, its utility demonstrated on more commonly used resin types and loadings, and the method must be effective on larger scale. To this end, we developed a simplified C-terminal hexaarginine tag (\u201cArgTag\u201d) and refined an enzymatic method for efficient removal with Carboxypeptidase B, enabling selective cleavage under mild, linker-free conditions. We evaluated the ArgTag across six solid supports (resins) of varying polarity and loading.

Although data leakage and generalizability concerns remain, data-driven methods for pose prediction (i.e. based on deep learning and diffusion) now routinely outperform traditional techniques such as molecular docking. In this work, we propose a simple data-driven ligand-based baseline for pose prediction which is based on maximal common substructure (MCS) to reference molecules, followed by constrained 3D embedding. As this TEMplate-based Protein-Ligand (TEMPL) baseline is strictly data-driven, it is a particularly meaningful baseline for interpolative tasks, where physics based methods sometimes underperform as they exploit data less directly. However, it can also highlight the added advantage of other interpolative data-driven methods that should outperform this simple approach. We applied our baseline method in the ASAP-Polaris-OpenADMET antiviral competition, achieving a result that outperformed some classic docking algorithms for the pose prediction of a series of ligands at the Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. Furthermore, we show the performance of our baseline is relatively good on a protein-ligand pose prediction benchmark used for deep learning based pose prediction, PDBBind, highlighting the risk of data leakage and necessity of challenging splits for other data-driven methods as well. We also show our baseline method has limited performance on more challenging benchmarks, such as PoseBusters. We provide our baseline method as open source software. For convenience and for non-technical users, we also provide a web application to run the pipeline.

Owing to its broad applicability to 1,2-difunctionalization of C\u2013C double and triple bonds without perturbing the phthalimide moiety, this strategy provides a versatile platform for rapid access to unsymmetrical disulfides. This utility is exemplified by the efficient hybridization of natural product derivatives (e.g., Corsifuran C, Boivinianin A) with bioactive agents (e.g., trimetazidine), highlighting the potential of this method in linker chemistry and drug discovery.

In type II PDT, the production of singlet oxygen (1O2) from triplet oxygen (3O2, ground state) upon light activation, in the presence of a photosensitizer (PS), is considered as the main mechanism responsible for cell death. Since hypoxia is an essential feature of the tumor microenvironment, it has therefore been accepted that PDT is rather inefficient in such conditions. For this reason, there is currently ongoing research towards the development of PSs that are working without the need for the presence of oxygen like PSs that function under type I PDT or of other techniques such as photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT). In this work, we tested the toxicity (IC50 values) of five clinically approved PSs (Protoporphyrin IX, Temoporfin, Talaporfin, LUZ11 and Chlorin e6) in three human cell lines under normoxic (20% 3O2) and hypoxic conditions (2% and 1% 3O2). To our surprise, the IC50 values between normoxia and hypoxia were basically identical. Only significant differences were observed for another known PS, namely Rose Bengal (RB), which is not approved clinically. However, this difference was rationalized by the inability of RB to induce type I PDT under hypoxia, explaining thus the different IC50 values obtained. Due to the unexpected and counter-intuitive nature of these observations, an independent laboratory was contacted to reproduce these results. As anticipated, this research group reached the same conclusions. Through specific ROS detection and photocatalytic oxidation assays, we proposed three potential explanations: contribution of type I PDT, residual type II PDT activity, and additional mechanisms such as photoredox catalysis, all of which could help overcome the limitations imposed by hypoxia. Overall, our results contradict the dogma currently in place stating the need of oxygen in PDT and open up the fundamental question of the mechanisms behind PDT.", "date": "2025-08-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Zeiler; Christian Slugovc", "abstract": "The combination of azole compounds like 1-methylimidazole and oxiranes (e.g. phenyl glycidyl ether) gives carbenoid reactivity at elevated temperatures. Benzoin condensation was performed with 5 mol% azole and 10 mol% oxirane under air at temperatures of 70 \u00b0C and above, achieving conversions of up to 85% of benzaldehyde and yields of up to 64% of benzoin. The lower benzoin yield is due to the formation of oxidative benzoin follow-up products under these reaction conditions. A variety of combinations of azole compounds and oxiranes have been shown to catalyze benzoin condensation. Thus, a modular, potentially inexpensive method of generating carbenoid reactivity has been revealed. The proposed mechanism for catalyst formation involves oxirane opening by, for example, 1-methylimidazole, which forms a zwitterionic methylimidazolium adduct with the oxirane. Then, the acidic proton in the 2-position of the imidazolium core is deprotonated by the zwitterion's alkoxide releasing the corresponding N-heterocyclic carbene. In addition to its primary function, surplus oxirane serves as a scavenger, removing acidic byproducts that are formed from the aldehyde through oxidative N-heterocyclic carbene catalysis. This property enables benzoin condensation without the exclusion of oxygen. The practical utility of this catalytic system was demonstrated by polymerizing simple bifunctional aldehyde/oxirane monomers - namely 4-(2-oxiranylmethoxy)-benzaldehyde, 3-(2-oxiranylmethoxy)-benzaldehyde and vanillin-based 2-methoxy-4-(2-oxiranylmethoxy)-benzaldehyde - using 5 mol % 1-methylimidazole in a solventless manner and without excluding air. The monomers polymerized via the formyl and the oxirane groups, yielded thermosets with glass transition temperatures above 100 \u00b0C.

Guided by structural insights, we designed and synthesized covalent inhibitors that exploit two key binding elements: Glu167 in the \u03b1-cleft (Site I), which mediates recognition of ubiquitin and ISG15, and the BL2 hydrophobic groove, which stabilizes inhibitor binding and shapes selectivity. The optimized inhibitors exhibited potent enzymatic inhibition (IC\u2085\u2080 = 25-100 nM), strong protein stabilization (\u0394T\u2098 > 20 \u00b0C), and submicromolar antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2\u2013infected A549-ACE2 cells (EC\u2085\u2080 = 130-350 nM), with no measurable cytotoxicity (CC\u2085\u2080 > 10 \u00b5M).

For this, a high-pressure permeability test rig was developed and is presented which allows quantitative measurements of gas leakage through composites. Two types of composites, braided and unidirectional cross-plies, were analyzed. As the textile architecture effects the damage structure, this allows a larger variety of damages and thus deeper understanding of the damage dependent permeability properties. Prior to impact loading, both braided and unidirectional cross-ply specimens exhibited near-FICKian gas diffusion behavior. However, permeability measurements revealed a significant difference between both, with unidirectional cross-ply specimens demonstrating 10 times higher permeability compared to the braided specimens. Microstructural investigations attributed this disparity to the higher crack density observed in unidirectional cross-ply specimens. Post impact loading, the permeability of both specimen types increased significantly by several orders of magnitude and showed no agreement with FICK\u2019s law. Microstructural analysis revealed the formation of interconnected crack networks throughout the impacted specimens, which facilitated large gas flows through the damaged regions.

Calculating differential binding energy and mean absolute displacement of the structures as a function of CO coverage, we propose a deformation quenching mechanism that partially determines saturation coverage. Extending this analysis to consider CO partial pressure, we show a phase change in CO step occupation, which we highlight as a viable explanation for previously reported temperature-programmed desorption and Fourier-transform infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy measurements. In addition, we explore the reactivity of Au adclusters toward CO dissociation at the dilute coverage limit.

Molecules in which electrons can occupy and interact with the (f-) orbitals of the metal and in a redox-active ligand offer an exceptional chance to tune these physicochemical properties. Here, an isostructural series of tris(3,5-dimethyl-1-pyrazolyl)borate (Tp*)-supported LnIII adducts of a redox non-innocent 3,5-di-tert-butyl-o-semiquinone (DTBSQ) ligand, (Tp*)2Ln(DTBSQ), is characterized experimentally and computationally for the first half of the series (La-Gd, except Pm), despite the redox activity of the semiquinone ligand. While the overall LnIII-DTBSQ bond distances decrease in line with decreasing LnIII ionic radii, theory suggests increased 4f -orbital mixing in the LnIII-DTBSQ are driven by the energetic accessibility of the f -shell. Deviations from trends are noticed experimentally and computationally, with critical radical contributions affecting the SmIII and EuIII bonding. Orbital analyses and multireference calculations confirm these originate from metal-ligand orbital energy matching, rather than through-space overlap. The interactions of the LnIII 4f orbitals are much larger with the polarizable radical ligand than with the ionic ancillary Tp* ligands, and show remarkably low 6s content, in contrast to all other common Ln-bound ligands studied, suggesting that the DTBSQ-based orbitals have the appropriate symmetry and energy to preferentially interact with the 4f orbitals over the 6s orbital.

Here, we use oil-in-water emulsions that mimic cellular environmental sensing and form directional arm-like filopodia in response to external chemical cues. Our work analyzes the step-by-step process involved in the formation of artificial filopodia, and we engineer ways to direct filopodia growth through different chemical gradients. The process is driven by asymmetric surfactant partitioning across the oil-water interface, followed by ordering at the interface to form lamellar structures, which are projected out as filopodia. We observe filopodia growing away from the source of kosmotropic anions and toward the source of chaotropic anions from the Hofmeister series. Significantly, these systems also respond to amino acid gradients, similar to cells: tryptophan gradients favor growth towards the source, while lysine and arginine gradients cause growth away from the amino acid source.

Mechanistic studies, such as ball-milling reaction kinetics, model reactions, and DFT calculations, revealed that coordination cages under direct mechanical impact are highly deformed, elevating their ground-state energies.

However, compared to the more established routes in two-dimensional (2D) crystals, the nature of LPE in 1D and q-1D crystals presents as a more random process. This distinction arises from the various available interchain directions across several crystallographic facets unique to 1D and q-1D solids, from which the chains can be cleaved apart into a stochastic combination of nanowires, nanoribbons, and nanosheets. Using the 1D ionic phase comprised of ~4.3 \u00c5 thin chains, (NbSe4)3I, we demonstrate herein the profound influence of crystal morphology, exposed facets and their degree of wettability, passivation, and surface roughness in directing the LPE behavior of 1D crystals.

Achieving this goal requires a compre-hensive understanding\n of the electrochemical behavior of these filaments. Here, we investigated how the electrochemical behavior of three commercial filaments was affected by alumina polishing, electrochemical activa-tion in 0.5 M NaOH, and electrodepositing Au nanoparticles (NPs). The goal of this study is to characterize if/how these commonly used pretreatments affect different filaments. The study is not an exhaustive combination of all filaments and pretreatment options. We characterized the physical properties of each filament/pretreatment using thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron mi-croscopy, and Raman microscopy measurements. We then benchmarked the background electro-chemical processes (capacitance and solvent window), the peak current response versus scan rate, and the peak potential separation of two common outer-sphere redox species (ruthenium hexamine and ferrocene methanol) for each filament under each pretreatment (i.e., nine total conditions). We subsequently investigated how the filaments responded to inner-sphere redox couples that were sur-face sensitive (ferrocyanide oxidation), dependent on surface adsorption (dopamine oxidation), and sensitive to surface oxides (Fe2+ oxidation). The data collectively underline the complexity of 3D-printed electrodes and highlight several important considerations that should be addressed when interpreting the electrochemistry of such materials. First, we present evidence that these materials behave as partially blocked electrodes, which complicates interpretations of electrochemical data. We also found that the outer-sphere electrochemical reactivity on a given filament was largely con-sistent regardless of pretreatment. The important variable for assessing outer-sphere electron trans-fer was the uncompensated resistance (Ru), which varies depending on the filament material, elec-trode size, and contact method. Finally, we observed that the selected filaments do not respond to pre-treatments identically when tested against inner-sphere redox species, suggesting that a variety of treatments should be evaluated when assessing conductive 3D-printed filament electrodes.

The energy descriptor was calculated using the single-component artificial force induced reaction (SC-AFIR) method, which autonomously and comprehensively searches for intermediates of a target reaction, and subsequently used to train machine learning models for reaction yield prediction. Linear models with regularization showed good predictions for the hold-out samples (RMSE < 7% yield) and the coefficients of the models provided information on how the energies of the intermediates should be adjusted to enhance the reaction yield. This work highlights the utility of energy descriptors in constructing mechanistically interpretable machine learning models for predictive tasks in chemistry.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Understanding the surface oxidation mechanism of CNTs enables precise control of the surface properties and fine-tuning of CNT device performance. In this study, photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM), which integrates infrared spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM), was for the first time used to visualize the oxidative functional groups on single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) bundles treated with a KMnO4/H2SO4 solution. SWCNTs grown by enhanced direct injection pyrolytic synthesis (eDIPS) were primary focus in this study. The PiFM imaging revealed the presence of oxidative functional groups including epoxides, alcohols, ketones and carboxylic acids on the surface of SWCNT bundles. The distribution of epoxides and other functional groups showed distinct differences, suggesting that the occurrence of a continuous chemical reaction involving epoxide cleavage and alcohol oxidation takes place during the oxidative treatment. The heterogeneity observed in each functional group also indicates that the surface functionalization and debundling of CNTs occurred simultaneously during the reaction. Furthermore, the functional group distribution of another type of as-grown SWCNTs synthesized by the water assisted super-growth method (SG-CNTs) was investigated. PiFM mapping results revealed that epoxides and alcohols were uniformly distributed on the as-grown SG-CNTs.

They have been developed as templates for reconstructing fiber-shaped tissues and mimic blood vessels, muscle fibers or neural networks in vivo. Alginates are overwhelmingly employed its core material to fabricate continuous hydrogel microfiber substrates, because of the simplicity of their processing. They, however, suffer from poor cell adherence and weak cell-matrix interactions. Alginates also need crosslinking, and thus easily lose shape and leach ions in the physiological environment. To overcome these challenges, we are reporting herein the first synthesis of pure chitosan fibers by microfluidics, avoiding the use of any crosslinking agent. These fibers have smooth surfaces and excellent cell viability of 85%, in the absence of any special coating, and a comparatively higher mechanical strength (695 MPa) than known alginate ones (2-4MPa). Our system also demonstrated the synthesis of chitin nanocrystals/chitosan composite microfibers with a smooth surface and crystals visible in the cross-section. Chitosan is a natural biopolymer obtained from the deacetylation of chitin, which is found in crustacean shells, insect cuticles, and fungi, and thus represents a sustainable source. Therefore, working with chitosan-derived materials helps us to address United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) 6 and 14. The fibers of pure chitosan and chitosan composite exhibit high processability and can be woven into a variety of structures.

The most important improvement is a novel embedding correction to the right-hand-side of the linear equations for the retained MP2 amplitudes, which includes the effect of integrals that are evaluated but discarded as below threshold. Together with a modified set of occupied orbitals that increases diagonal dominance in the occupied-occupied Fock operator, and an on-the-fly block Kapuy solver for below-threshold amplitudes, this scheme provides roughly an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy.

Nevertheless, elucidating the solution conformation of CLPs remains a significant challenge in the field of polymer physics, owing to the difficulty of synthesizing defect-free samples, their intrinsically low solubility that results in weak signals and limited analytical accuracy, the pronounced tendency of CLPs to aggregate even when dissolved, and the absence of reliable theoretical models. Here, these fundamental challenges are addressed by the synthesis, neutron scattering measurements, and computational simulations of two model CLPs, LP1 and LP2. Owing to their bulky three-dimensional side chains, LP1 and LP2 exhibit non-aggregated character and high dispersibility as single polymer chains. Small-angle neutron scattering revealed unexpectedly low persistence lengths (Lp) of 3\u20135 nm. The similar Lp to those of non-ladder conjugated polymers such as P3HT indicates the long-range conformational semi-flexibility of CLPs despite possessing ladder-type constitution. Machine learning-based molecular dynamics simulations further showed that the semi-flexibility of these CLP chains mainly results from the pronounced out-of-plane deformations, which is synergistically influenced by the steric congestion of the side chains.

Herein, via bioinformatics analysis, we found that C\u2013H/O interactions between a side-chain oxygen and Pro C\u2013H can stabilize the cis-proline conformation at Glu-Pro, Asp-Pro, Gln-Pro, Asn-Pro, Ser-Pro, and Thr-Pro sequences. These C\u2013H/O interactions are apparently most stabilizing at Glu-Pro sequences, which have a substantially higher than average frequency of cis-proline (7.1% of all Glu-Pro amide bonds in the PDB). DFT calculations were conducted to understand the basis and geometries of C\u2013H/O interactions in these sequences. Computationally, these residues all exhibit close C\u2013H/O interactions (substantially below the 2.72 \u00c5 sum of the van der Waals radii of H and O), with the closest C\u2013H/O interactions observed with the anionic oxygens of Glu and Asp, and with closer interactions for the anionic residues than the neutral carboxamides Gln and Asn.

Their appeal is countered by the stability challenges arising from inherent lattice softness and labile surface ligand bonding. Recent ligand design efforts have drastically improved the structural integrity of LHP NCs by pursuing strongly and statically bound ligands, as found with zwitterionic head groups. Here we venture into a new class of cationic ligands featuring guanidinium head groups, which combine the compactness of primary ammoniums with the deprotonation resistance of quaternary ammoniums. We reasoned that strong yet dynamic ligand binding offers distinct benefits. A library of aliphatic guanidinium molecules was synthesized and surveyed as capping ligands for CsPbBr3, FAPbBr3, and CsPbI3 NCs, enabling up to 95 % photoluminescence quantum yields for bromide compositions. We then compare binding behavior of guanidinium ligands with those of other widely used ligands. Zwitterionic ligands phosphocholines and phosphoethanolamines bind more strongly than sulfobetaines and quaternary ammonium ligands, yet all these head groups impart relatively static binding with exchange rates below 5 s-1. Primary ammonium ligands champion in dynamicity but lag behind in ligand-coverage retention and, hence, long-term stability. Guanidinium ligands strike a favorable balance: they match the binding dynamics of primary ammonium ligands, while significantly enhancing binding strength, enabling rigorous purification and compatibility with relatively polar solvents such as tetrahydrofuran. We then showcase the benefits of dynamically bound ligands in photocatalytic C-C coupling reactions.", "date": "2025-08-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this study, we present a comprehensive machine learning-based framework for estimating CO\u2082 storage capacity and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) performance simultaneously in subsurface reservoirs.\n      Our methodology combines simulation-driven uncertainty quantification with supervised machine learning to develop predictive surrogate models.

Metallic platinum-platinum (Pt\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Pt) interactions provide a distinctive driving force for supramolecular assembly due to their strong, directional, and long-range nature. Despite their importance, the microscopic dynamics underlying the self-assembly of Pt(II) complexes remain challenging to probe experimentally. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can capture these processes at atomic resolution, but extracting kinetic pathways is complicated by the indistinguishability and permutation of identical monomers within self-assembled structures. In this study, we employ GraphVAMPnet, a deep learning framework based on graph neural networks (GNN), on extensive MD simulations of amphiphilic PtB complexes during the early stage of self-assembly. GraphVAMPnet inherently accounts for permutational, rotational, and translational invariance, making it well suited for analyzing self-assembly dynamics. Our analysis reveals three slow collective variables (CVs) that govern PtB self-assembly. The slowest mode (CV1) separates two distinct kinetic growth routes: an incremental growth mechanism, in which single monomers join existing aggregates with predominantly anti-parallel packing (CV3), and a hopping growth mechanism, in which clusters of smaller size merge via heterogeneous collisions, yielding a mix of anti-parallel and parallel packing arrangements (CV2). Further energetic analysis indicates that incremental growth is favored, potentially leading to the well-ordered nanosheet morphologies observed experimentally.

While existing methods, such as Markov State Models and non-Markovian approaches built from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, can effectively capture metastable states, they struggle to identify transition states. Transition state identification via dispersion and variational principle regularized neural networks (TS-DAR) is a computational framework that utilizes out-of-distribution detection to systematically identify all transition states involved in specific biomolecular conformational changes. TS-DAR leverages a deep learning model to map protein conformations from MD simulations onto a hyperspherical latent space. This low-dimensional representation retains the critical kinetic information of biomolecular conformational changes. To distinguish metastable states from transition states, TS-DAR utilizes a VAMP-2 and dispersion loss function, enabling the automated identification of transition state conformations. This framework provides a comprehensive view of protein conformational landscapes and facilitates studies on drug binding, enzyme activity, and mutation effects.

The reactive processing (RP) method is one of the emerging technologies for producing CNFRPs, promoting the nanofibrillation of cellulose during kneading and simultaneously dispersing it into the base polymer, and is therefore expected to reduce life cycle greenhouse gas (LC-GHG) emissions from structural materials such as automotive parts. Their environmental impacts should be assessed in advance. However, at this stage, the composites are usually produced by small-scale or inefficient processes, making proper evaluation challenging. In this study, we performed a prospective life cycle assessment for CNF-reinforced bio-polyethylene (CNF/bioPE) and CNF-reinforced fossil-derived polyethylene polypropylene (CNF/PP) in comparison with talc-reinforced polypropylene (talc/PP), commonly used in automotive parts. The estimates are based on actual measurement data from laboratory-scale equipment, considering the influence of technological development and scale-up by industrial implementation. The results show that only CNF/bioPE has lower LC-GHG emissions than talc/PP. This remains true regardless of the scenarios, whether including or excluding the effects of bagasse power generation and high or low direct land use changes (dLUC) associated with sugarcane cultivation in the production of bioPE. The LCA based on LIME impact categories shows that there are some categories in which CNF/bioPE has a higher impact than talc/PP. However, in the integration category, the impact of CNF/bioPE is lower than that of talc/PP. This suggests that substituting talc/PP with CNF/bioPE could reduce overall environmental impacts. Contributing to this result is the CO2 absorption effect during bioPE production.

This re-evaluation utilizes explicitly correlated MP2-F12 near the complete basis set limit, CCSD(F12*)/VQZ-F12, and a (T) correction from conventional CCSD(T)/haV{T,Q}Z calculations.

The development of high-performance probes is essential for achieving high-quality imaging outcomes. Owing to their unique photophysical properties, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens have been recognized as an ideal platform for constructing advanced NIR-II organic fluorescent probes. However, the brightness of current NIR-II AIE probes remains suboptimal concerning practical applications due to intrinsic molecular constraints and environmental quenching effects. To address these issues, a high-brightness NIR-II AIE nanoprobe, TT12,8-B NPs, was developed based on the proposed design strategy of increasing molecular alkyl lengths, which simultaneously enhances aggregate hydrophobicity and expands intermolecular packing distance, synergistically improving both molar absorptivity and quantum yield (QY). Notably, the optimized TT12,8-B NPs exhibit nearly fourfold higher brightness than TPE-BBT NPs, which is one of the highest-QY NIR-II AIE probes reported currently. Coupled with optimal particle size, good water dispersibility, outstanding photostability and biosafety, TT12,8-B NPs enabled high-clarity multiscale vasculature imaging in mice and rabbits, attaining an unprecedented signal-to-background ratio exceeding 10 and a record-high vascular resolution of 49 \u03bcm in diameter, setting new benchmarks in NIR-II fluorescence angiography. Furthermore, the exceptional angiographic performance of TT12,8-B NPs further facilitated early malignant tumor detection and discrimination between nascent and established tumors.

So far, the best-performing rung-4 hybrids were MPW1B95-D3(BJ) with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.67 kcal/mol and \u03c9B97M-V (2.78 kcal/mol). This work focuses on range-separated local hybrids (RSLHs), a recent class of rung-4 functionals that use both a real-space dependent and inter-electronic distance dependent admixture of exact (Hartree-Fock-like) exchange. Strong-correlation corrected RSLHs (scRSLHs) based on real-space non-dynamical correlation models are also assessed. The best-performing functional is the scRSLH \u03c9LH23tdB-D4 with an MAE of 2.46 kcal/mol. Overall, the results reflect a systematic improvement in accuracy along the functional development series from LH to RSLH to scRSLH. However, our analysis also indicates that the real-space non-dynamical correlation model is not the primary driver of this improvement, which is instead dominated by other features of the functional design. Additionally, we studied (sc)(RS)LHs for the ENZYMES22 set of enzyme reactions comprising metal-free active site models as well as the ECR20 benchmark of net reaction energies of enzyme catalyzed reactions. MAEs of 1.45 kcal/mol and 0.63 kcal/mol confirm \u03c9LH23tdB-D4 as one of the top-performing functionals for these sets.

Single-channel electrophysiological recordings demonstrate that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the kemptide enhances ion transport activity. When embedded in HeLa cell membranes, these channels are activated by PKA and elevate Ca\u00b2\u207a influx, resulting in a 48 % reduction of cell growth after 24 h.

While recent studies have shown that molecularly-defined W(IV)-oxo species initiate olefin metathesis through C\u2013H bond activation and proton transfer steps to generate metallacyclobutanes, less is known about the corresponding Mo-based systems. Here, we report the synthesis of a pyridine-stabilized Mo(IV)-oxo compound [MoO(OC(CF3)3)2py3] and show that this compound also initiates olefin metathesis, once activated with B(C6F5)3. This activation is evaluated to have a low efficiency (\u22480.2 %) and illustrates the difficulty to generate active species from low valent sites, thus explaining the relatively low activity of classical heterogeneous catalysts.

Using extensive global optimization searches combined with \\textit{ab initio} thermodynamics, we identify synthesizable surface phases across a range of surface boron stoichiometries. The resulting surfaces display a wealth of geometric and electronic structures, whose origins are traced to dopant-stabilized boron rearrangements. These non-uniform multi-site surfaces bind different adsorbates through distinct modes, thus making it impossible to comply with conventional catalysis models such as scaling relations.

Despite their importance, achieving stereo-controlled chemical synthesis of C-glycosides remains a significant challenge in organic chemistry. In this work, we present a novel and efficient method for the stereo-controlled synthesis of C-glycosides via C(sp3)\u2013C(sp2) Suzuki-Miyaura type cross-coupling, introducing sugar aryl thioether as an electrophilic coupling partner. Our strategy focuses on developing an easily accessible and bench-stable S-linked tetrazole glycosyl donor via a one-pot synthesis from free sugar, which subsequently serves as a strong electrophilic coupling partner with boronic acid. Interestingly, this robust technique has a significant level of stereospecificity, allowing for the selective synthesis of both anomeric configurations directly from their respective glycosyl donors. The reactivity and versatility of this reaction are demonstrated in over 40 examples, including different monosaccharides and disaccharides. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of the method was highlighted by the synthesis of different sugar analogues of the antidiabetic drug Ipragliflozin. Mechanistic studies show that oxidative addition occurs at the anomeric centre by polarizing the C-S bond with the S-linked 1-phenyl-tetrazole group and lowering the activation barrier for the rate-determining step. The distinct reactivity of aryl thio-ether as an electrophilic cross-coupling partner may open new possibilities for the straightforward asymmetric C-C bond formation reactions in organic synthesis.

Metastasis, the occurrence of cancer at sites different from the primary tumor, can affect multiple organs, compromising their function or altering their metabolism, and eventually leads to death. In fact, metastasis is the main cause of death in the majority of cancer patients. Considering the severe implications of cancer on patient survival and quality of life, the early identification of metastases is pivotal in the effective treatment of cancer.  Since routine diagnostic practice relies on a time-consuming staining process and the use of antibodies to detect selected molecular markers, it is limited by a lack of real-time data and the availability of molecular information. Against this background, techniques based on rapid chemical analysis to identify migratory properties are highly desirable. Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has a long history in the label-free identification of infrared marker bands for cancer detection. However, it requires extensive post-processing of the acquired spectra, is not suitable for analysis in aqueous environments and has poor spatial resolution.   To overcome these challenges, we are using a new method termed Optical Photothermal Infrared (O-PTIR) spectroscopy to detect local absorption to establish IR tumor markers and classification models. We report on experimental outcomes using machine learning and IR spectroscopy for the classification of cells and the identification of markers for cancer and migratory properties, comparing conventional FTIR microscopy to a custom O-PTIR instrument.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Anal.

In this study, we demonstrate how strategic ortho-chlorine substitution in a triphenylamine (TPA)-based donor-acceptor (D-A) system significantly improves reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) efficiency by simultaneously reducing the singlet-triplet energy gap (\u0394EST) and enhancing spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Through combined spectroscopic and theoretical analysis, we reveal that chlorine-induced molecular distortion of two side phenyl rings of TPA and increased rigidity lead to lower reorganization energies, while collectively these factors facilitate an over 20-fold enhancement in rISC rates. Notably, the modified emitter (diClDa-CNBPz) exhibits higher photoluminescence quantum yield, reduced sensitivity to external media, and optimized triplet harvesting via both 3CT-1CT and 3LE-1CT pathways. The latter is responsible for the enhanced SOC owing to a heavy-atom effect. When incorporated into OLEDs, diClDa-CNBPz achieves twice the external quantum efficiency and a fourfold reduction in efficiency roll-off compared to the unsubstituted counterpart. Additionally, its application in NIR hyperfluorescent OLEDs further underscores the benefits of enhanced triplet harvesting.

A molecular simulation to predict the Henry coefficient of a MOF constitutes a Monte Carlo integration where each sample consists of inserting an adsorbate in the MOF at a random position and orientation then calculating the MOF-adsorbate interaction energy.\n\nOur idea is to leverage top-K arm identification algorithms, developed for the multi-armed bandit problem in reinforcement learning, to sequentially and adaptively allocate adsorbate-insertions among the MOFs in a data-driven manner to obtain the most accurate top-K subset under a fixed insertion budget. By analogy, each MOF is a slot machine in a casino that, upon pulling its arm (inserting an adsorbate), offers a stochastic reward (a noisy estimate of its Henry coefficient) sampled from a static, unknown probability distribution. Each adaptive allocation algorithm (1) proceeds in a feedback loop of (i) allocate adsorbate-insertions to MOF(s), (ii) update the running estimates of the Henry coefficients of the MOF(s), then (iii) judiciously allocate adsorbate insertions to the next MOF(s); (2) sequentially dials-up the fidelities of ongoing molecular simulations in the MOFs, giving a multi-fidelity computational screening; (3) circumvents the need for hand-crafting structural or chemical features of the MOFs.\n\nAs a case study, we implement, benchmark, and analyze the sequential halving, successive accepts and rejects, and narrowing exploration (our proposed heuristic) algorithms to adaptively allocate xenon insertions to screen a set of ca. 300 MOFs for the top-K Xe Henry coefficient subset over differing insertion budgets. Provided with a sufficient budget, we find that these adaptive insertion algorithms can significantly reduce (by a factor of two to three) the simple regret (sum of true minus empirical top-K true Henry coefficients) and error in the top-K subset of MOFs output by a computational screening. By another metric, adaptive insertion allocation provided a 35% discount on the computational cost to identify the top-K MOFs with less than 5% error. We thereby demonstrate that top-K arm identification algorithms may generally be useful for more efficiently screening materials for various properties via Monte Carlo molecular simulations and enabling the adoption of more sophisticated force fields or even ab initio calculations for the potential energy of configurations to lend higher-fidelity screenings.

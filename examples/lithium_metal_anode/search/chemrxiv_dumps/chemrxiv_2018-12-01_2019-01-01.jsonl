In this study,\nwe propose epigenetic recording of varied cell environment and complex history could\nbe an origin of cellular aging. Through epigenetic modifications, the environment\nand historical events can induce the chromatin template into activated or repressive\naccessible structure, thereby shaping the DNA template into a spectrum of\nchromatin states. The inner nature of diversity and conflicts born by cell environment\nand its historical events are hence recorded into the chromatin template. This\ncould result in a dissipated spectrum of chromatin state and chaos of overall\ngene expressions. An unavoidable degradation of epigenome entropy, similar to <i>Shannon</i> entropy, would be consequently\ninduced. The resulted disorder in epigenome, characterized by corrosion of epigenome\nentropy as reflected in chromatin template, can be stably memorized and propagated\nthrough cell divisions. Furthermore, hysteresis nature of epigenetics responding\nto emerging environment could exacerbate the degradation of epigenome entropy. Besides\nstochastic errors, we propose that epigenetics disorder and chaos derived from unordered\nenvironment and complex cell experiences play an essential role in epigenetic\ndrift and the as-resulted cellular aging.", "date": "2018-12-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Cell and Molecular Biology; Environmental biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The hydrolytic stability of the various forms of boron nitride, including porous boron nitride, has been sparingly addressed in the literature. Here, we map the physical-chemical properties of the material to its hydrolytic stability for a range of conditions. Using analytical, imaging and spectroscopic techniques, we identify the links between the hydrolytic instability of porous boron nitride and its limited crystallinity, high porosity as well as the presence of oxygen atoms. To address this instability issue, we demonstrate that subjecting the material to a thermal treatment leads to the formation of crystalline domains of h-BN exhibiting a hydrophobic character. The heat-treated sample exhibits enhanced hydrolytic stability, while maintaining a high porosity.

Red phosphorus (RP) is a promising candidate as an anode for sodium-ion batteries because of its low potential and high specific capacity. Its main disadvantage is its 490% volumetric expansion during sodiation. This leads to particle pulverization and substantial reduction of the cycle life. Furthermore, RP has an extremely low electronic conductivity of 10<sup>-14</sup> S cm<sup>-1</sup>. Both issues have been previously addressed by ball milling RP with a carbon matrix. This decreases the RP particle size and also forms a more electronically conductive composite. However, it is challenging to determine the RP particle size independent of the size of the composite particles. Consequently, little is known about how much the RP particle size must be reduced to improve anode performance. Here we quantify the relationship between the RP particle-size distribution and its cycle life for the first time by separating the ball milling process into two steps. An initial wet ball milling is used to control the RP particle-size distribution, which is measured via dynamic light scattering. This is followed by a dry milling step to produce RP-graphite composites. We found that wet milling breaks apart the largest RP particles in the range of 2 to 10 \u00b5m decreases the Dv90 from 1.85 to 1.26 \u00b5m and significantly increases the cycle life of the RP. Furthermore, we determined that the length of time of the second milling step affects the uniformity of the carbon distribution in the composite. Photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirms the successful formation of a carbon coating, thus improving the performance of the resulting material. The RP with a Dv90 of 0.79 \u00b5m mixed with graphite for 48h delivered 1,354 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> with high coulombic efficiency (>99%) and cyclability (88% capacity retention after 100 cycles).

Here, we rationally assemble 1D biological\ntemplates into scalable, 3D structures to fabricate metal nanofoams with a\nvariety of genetically programmable architectures and material\nchemistries.  We demonstrate that\nnanofoam architecture can be modulated by manipulating viral assembly,\nspecifically by editing the viral surface coat protein, as well as altering\ntemplating density.   These architectures\nwere retained over a broad range of compositions including monometallic and\nbi-metallic combinations of noble and transition metals of copper, nickel,\ncobalt, and gold.  Phosphorous and boron\nincorporation was also explored. In addition to increasing the surface area\nover a factor of 50, as compared to the nanofoam\u2019s geometric footprint, this\nprocess also resulted in a decreased average crystal size and altered phase\ncomposition as compared to non-templated controls. Finally, templated hydrogels\nwere deposited on the centimeter scale into an array of substrates as well as\nfree standing foams, demonstrating the scalability and flexibility of this\nsynthetic method towards device integration. \nAs such, we anticipate that this method will provide a platform to\nbetter study the synergistic and de-coupled effects between nano-structure and\ncomposition for a variety of applications including energy storage, catalysis,\nand sensing.", "date": "2018-12-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Alloys; Catalysts; Core-Shell Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Nanocatalysis - Catalysts & Materials; Nanofabrication; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Bioengineering and Biotechnology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we use calculations to explore the influence of the nitrogen position on the charge mobility of a chiral organic molecule when the crystal packing is kept constant. The transfer integrals for a series of enantiopure aza[6]helicene crystals sharing the same packing were analysed in order to identify the best supramolecular motifs to promote charge carrier mobility.

The simulations showed that even this small change in the chemical structure has a strong effect on the charge transport in the crystal, leading to differences in charge mobility of up to one order of magnitude. Some aza[6]helicene isomers that were packed interlocked with each other showed high HOMO-HOMO integrals (up to 70 meV), whilst molecules arranged with translational symmetry generally afforded the highest LUMO-LUMO integrals (40 - 70 meV).

Judicious control over a number of synthetic variables is required to select for the desired topology and control features such as interpenetration and defectivity, which have significant impact on physical properties and application. Herein, we present a comprehensive investigation of self-assembly in the Fe-biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylate system, demonstrating that coordination modulation, the addition of competing ligands into solvothermal syntheses, can reliably tune between the kinetic product, non-interpenetrated MIL-88D(Fe), and the thermodynamic product, two-fold interpenetrated MIL-126(Fe). DFT simulations reveal that correlated disorder of the terminal anions on the metal clusters in the interpentrated phase results in H-bonding between adjacent nets and is the thermodynamic driving force for its formation. Coordination modulation slows self-assembly and therefore selects the thermodynamic product MIL-126(Fe), while offering fine control over defectivity, inducing mesoporosity, but electron microscopy shows the MIL-88D(Fe) phase persists in many samples despite not being evident in diffraction experiments, suggesting its presence accounts for the lower than predicted surface areas reported for samples to date. Interpenetration control is also demonstrated by utilizing the 2,2'-bipyridine-5,5'-dicarboxylate linker; DFT simulations show that it is energetically prohibitive for it to adopt the twisted conformation required to form the interpenetrated phase, and are confirmed by experimental data, although multiple alternative phases are identified due to additional coordination of the Fe cations to the N-donors of the ligand. Finally, we introduce oxidation modulation \u2013 the concept of using metal precursors in a different oxidation state to that found in the final MOF \u2013 as a further protocol to kinetically control self-assembly. Combining coordination and oxidation modulation allows the synthesis of pristine MIL-126(Fe) with BET surface areas close to the predicted maximum capacity for the first time, suggesting that combining the two may be a powerful methodology for the controlled self-assembly of high-valent MOFs.<br /><br />", "date": "2018-12-14", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Kinetics and Mechanism - Inorganic Reactions; Solid State Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Inorg.); Self-Assembly", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This leads to slow convergence of thermodynamic averages for such systems. We have addressed this challenge by efficiently integrating standard Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) translational water moves with MD in the AMBER simulation package. The translational moves allow water to easily enter or exit buried sites in a thermodynamically correct way during a simulation. To maximize efficiency, the algorithm avoids moves that only interchange waters within the bulk around the protein, instead focusing on moves that can transfer water between bulk and the protein interior. In addition, a steric grid allows avoidance of moves that would lead to obvious steric clashes, and a fast grid-based energy evaluation is used to reduce the number of expensive full energy calculations. The potential energy distribution produced using MC/MD was found to be statistically indistinguishable from that of control simulations using only MD, and the algorithm effectively equilibrated water across steric barriers and into binding pockets that are not accessible with pure MD. The MC/MD method introduced here should be of increasing utility for applications spanning protein folding, the elucidation of protein mechanisms, and free energy calculations for computer-aided drug design.

This work reports our initial experiments to support nickel on mesoporous zirconia. Nickel (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)2 [Ni(thd)2] was reacted in a fixed-bed ALD reactor with zirconia, characterised with BET surface area of 72 m2/g and mean pore size of 14 nm. According to X-ray fluorescence measurements, the average nickel loading on the top part of the support bed was on the order of 1 wt-%, corresponding to circa one nickel atom per square nanometre. Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive spectroscopy confirmed that in the top part of the fixed support bed, nickel was distributed throughout the zirconia particles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the nickel oxidation state to be two. Organic thd ligands remained complete on the surface after the Ni(thd)2 reaction with zirconia, as followed with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. The ligands could be fully removed by oxidation at 400 \u00b0C. These initial results indicate that nickel catalysts on zirconia can likely be made by ALD. Before catalytic testing, in addition to increasing the nickel loading by repeated ALD cycles, optimization of the process parameters is required to ensure uniform distribution of nickel throughout the support bed and within the zirconia particles.", "date": "2018-12-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysts; Materials Processing; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Thin Films; Nanocatalysis - Catalysts & Materials; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While this general behaviour is well known, the\nabsence of long-range order precludes a determination of the preferred\narrangements of Si and Ge atoms at the corners of <i>d4r</i> cages by means of crystallographic methods. If fluoride anions\nare present during the synthesis, these are incorporated into the <i>d4r</i> cages. Due to the sensitivity of the\n<sup>19</sup>F chemical shift to the local environment, NMR experiments can\nprovide indirect insights into the predominant (Si,Ge) arrangements. However,\nconflicting interpretations have been reported, both with regard to the\npreference for, or avoidance of, Ge-O-Ge linkages, and concerning the\nequilibrium position of fluorine inside the cage, where fluorine might either occupy\nthe cage centre or participate in a partly covalent Ge-F bond. In order to shed\nlight on the energetically preferred local arrangements, periodic electronic\nstructure calculations in the framework of dispersion-corrected density\nfunctional theory (DFT) were performed. The AST framework was used as a suitable\nmodel system, as this zeolite is synthetically accessible across the range of\n(Si<sub>1-n</sub>,Ge<sub>n</sub>)O<sub>2</sub> compositions (0 \u2264 <i>n</i> \u2264 1). DFT structure optimisations for (Si,Ge)-AST\nsystems containing fluoride anions and organic cations revealed that\narrangements of Si and Ge at the cage vertices which maximise the number of\nGe-O-Ge linkages are energetically preferred, and that fluorine tends to form\nrelatively short (~2.2 to 2.4 \u00c5) bonds to Ge atoms that are surrounded by\nGe-O-Ge linkages. The preference for Ge-O-Ge linkages disappears in the absence\nof fluorine, pointing to a \u201ctemplating\u201d effect of the anions. In addition to\nthe prediction of equilibrium structures, DFT-based Molecular Dynamics\ncalculations were performed for selected AST models in order to analyse the\ndynamics of fluoride anions confined to <i>d4r</i>\ncages. These calculations showed that the freedom of movement of fluorine\nvaries markedly depending on the local environment, and that it correlates with\nthe average Ge-F distance (short Ge-F bonds = restricted motion). An analysis\nof the Ge-F radial distribution functions provided no evidence for a\ncoexistence of separate local energy minima at the cage centre and in the\nproximity of a germanium atom for any of the systems considered. The\ncomputational approach pursued in this work provides important new insights\ninto the local structure of silicogermanate zeolites with <i>d4r</i> units, enhancing the atomic-level understanding of these\nmaterials.

We therefore systematically studied the action spectroscopy of homo-base 6-mer DNA strands (dG6, dA6, dC6, dT6) and discuss the results in light of gas-phase structures validated by ion mobility spectrometry and infrared ion spectroscopy, of electron binding energies measured by photoelectron spectroscopy, and of calculated electronic photo-absorption spectra. When UV photons interact with oligonucleotide polyanions, two main actions may take place: (1) fragmentation and (2) electron detachment. The action spectra reconstructed from fragmentation follow the absorption spectra well, and result from multiple cycles of absorption and internal conversion. The action spectra reconstructed from the electron photodetachment (ePD) efficiency reveal interesting phenomena: ePD depends on the charge state because it depends on electron binding energies. We illustrate with the G-quadruplex [dTG4T]4 that the ePD action spectrum shifts with the charge state, pointing to possible caveats when comparing the spectra of systems having different charge densities to deduce structural parameters. Moreover, ePD is particularly efficient for purines but not pyrimidines. ePD thus reflects not only absorption, but also particular relaxation pathways of the electronic excited states.

Reasoning from TD-DFT calculations of an HKUST-1 model system bound to monomers, we rationalize the observed reactivity and propose an initiation mechanism based on a ligand-to-metal charge transfer state.</div>", "date": "2018-12-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Metamaterials; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Oligomers; Thin Films; Conducting polymers; Supramolecular Chemistry (Inorg.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

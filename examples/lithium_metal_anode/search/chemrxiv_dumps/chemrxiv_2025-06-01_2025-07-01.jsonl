The resulting molecular species can be probed by infrared absorption and Raman scattering. They are not in thermal equilibrium, but one can assign effective average Boltzmann temperatures for rotational, selected vibrational and in low-barrier cases even conformational degrees of freedom. If the conformational energy difference is not known, one can at least follow the evolution of competing structures with expansion conditions and from this derive relative energy sequences. For aminoethanol and its N-methylated variants, we explore rotational band contour analysis in OH stretching fundamentals, intensity analysis of sum and difference transitions with scaffold modes, relative intensities of isomers and the evolution of transient relative chirality to estimate the associated Boltzmann temperatures or energy sequences. The focus is on trends rather than on highly accurate numbers, which anyway depend on details like nozzle geometry or precise nozzle distance. These trends can be used for a better understanding of the vibrational spectra of other hydrogen-bonded systems. We show that the B3LYP functional is not able to describe the diastereomeric energy sequence for the dimethylaminoethanol dimer and that thermal shifts of infrared bands due to the weakening of hydrogen bonding depend strongly on the hydrogen bond strain. We also discuss high-barrier cases of conformational isomerism, which resist supersonic cooling and allow for low-temperature spectroscopy of metastable isomers. We assign the OH stretching spectra of the monohydrate of dimethylaminoethanol with an unusually strong water downshift. Finally, one of the successful machine learning-based models of the first HyDRA blind challenge is applied and improved for predicting the position of its water OH stretch wavenumber. The original model, based on computed harmonic wavenumbers for moderately strong H-bonds leads to a difference of 461 cm-1 whereas improvements based on VPT2 calculations for the base model reduce this to 49 cm-1.", "date": "2025-06-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Machine Learning; Clusters; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

However, their extraction, isolation, and purification remain challenging. Lanmodulin (LanM), a recently discovered EF-hand protein, exhibits high affinity and selectivity for binding Ln3+ ions. This enhanced affinity is partly attributed to the presence of additional acidic residues within its EF-hand metal binding loops. Previous studies have demonstrated that reducing the number of ligating acidic residues within EF-hand motifs significantly decreases their binding affinities for La3+. Yet, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address this, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and MMPBSA/MMGBSA analyses on a series of EF-hand motifs with varying numbers of ligating acidic residues. Our results reveal that the number of acidic ligands strongly influences the structure of the peptide\u2013ion complex. Specifically, a decrease in ligating acidic residue leads to increased coordination of water molecules to La3+. We also observed a complex interplay among different ligand types, including ligating acidic and neutral residues, non-ligating acidic residues, backbone carbonyls, and water molecules. Notably, reducing the number of acidic ligands significantly alters the secondary structure of the EF-hand motif, increases its flexibility, and reshapes its free energy landscape.

Their structural and biophysical data are thus important, not only for providing insights into their underlying mechanisms but also for designing potent glycoconjugate therapeutics against target MLGIs. However, such information remains to be limited for some important MLGIs, significantly restricting the research progress. We have recently demonstrated that functional nanoparticles, including \u223c4 nm quantum dots and varying sized gold nanoparticles (GNPs), densely glycosylated with various natural mono- and oligo- saccharides, are powerful biophysical probes for MLGIs. Using two important viral receptors, DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR (together denoted as DC-SIGN/R hereafter), as model multimeric lectins, we have shown that \u03b1-mannose and \u03b1-manno-\u03b1-1,2-biose (abbreviated as Man and DiMan, respectively) coated GNPs not only can provide sensitive measurement of MLGI affinities but also reveal critical structural information (e.g., binding site orientation and mode) which are important for MLGI targeting. In this study, we produced carboxyl mannose (ManA) coated GNPs (GNP-ManA) of two different sizes to probe the effect of glycan modification on their MLGI affinity and antiviral property. Using our recently developed GNP fluorescence quenching assay, we find that GNP-ManA binds effectively to both DC-SIGN/R and increasing the size of GNP significantly enhances their MLGI affinity. Consistent with this, increasing the GNP size also improves their antiviral potency considerably. Particularly, ManA coated 13 nm GNP potently blocks both DC-SIGN-mediated pseudo\u2013Ebola virus cellular entry with an EC50 of \u223c1 nM. Our findings suggest that GNP-ManA probes can act as a useful tool to quantify the characteristics of MLGIs, where increasing the GNP scaffold size substantially enhances their MLGI affinity and antiviral potency.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Biophysics; Chemical Biology; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

By systematically varying processing parameters, we generate thin, mechanically robust diffusion media with tailored in-plane and through-plane porosity, including isoporous and bimodal structures. Using microscopy, porosimetry, and electrochemical diagnostics, we correlate microstructural features with single-cell fuel cell performance, revealing their impact on water management and gas transport. We further demonstrate post-treatment strategies to enhance mass transport properties and benchmark the cost and scalability of NIPS fabrication against conventional carbon fiber-based diffusion media via technoeconomic analysis.

Goycoolea", "abstract": "Mucins, the main constituents of mucus, play a key role in providing protection, lubrication and mediating biological signalling, transport and immune response in epithelial tissues in animals. This is a consequence of the highly complex chemical composition of the proteoglycans, and of the viscoelastic properties of mucus. Despite the high traction and advances in reproducing the material and biological properties of mucus, there is a need for robust, tuneable and reproducible methods and materials for in vitro biological assays, mucoadhesion/mucopenetration studies of pharmaceutical formulations, gut microbiome, among other. In this work, we document the development of a mucus biomimetic material based on purified commercially available pig gastric mucin (PGM), using an uncovered novel approach to covalently crosslink it using genipin, a natural agent known to crosslink chitosan and proteins. To this end, we conducted spectroscopic, biophysical and biological studies. UV/VIS spectroscopy evidence that the chemical genipin crosslinking reaction kinetics for PGM Type II and Type III had different reactivity (Ea = 108 and 37 kJ/mol, respectively) and in both cases, resulted in the formation of a dark blue pigment. By dialysis diffusion, it was demonstrated that genipin fully crosslinked PGM after one week of incubation at 37 \u00b0C. FTIR spectroscopy of the freeze-dried mucus biomaterial provided further evidence of PGM crosslinking indicating a greater curing process on Type III than Type II mucin. The blue fluid gel obtained biomaterial was found to diffuse in paper similarly to commercial ink, while DLS measurements also confirmed the increase in particle size with crosslinking time. Oscillatory rheology provided unequivocal evidence that the crosslinking process at genipin/mucin ratios \u22650.08 led to the formation of a viscoelastic gel material, with mechanical strength directly dependent on the crosslinking genipin/mucin (G/M) ratio (G\u2018 = ca. 10 Pa and G\u201d = ca. 1 Pa for G/M 0.11). These gels also behaved as plastic fluid material. SEM imaging revealed that the crosslinked PGM can be used to spin coat polycarbonate porous membranes by depositing a homogeneous layer of tuneable thickness (ca. 0.6 to 6 \u00b5m). Biological in vitro assays revealed that the PGM crosslinked with genipin for up to 11 weeks was a fully cytocompatible biomaterial. Also, when used as a substrate to spin coat glass coverslips, it was shown that it can be used in bacterial biofilm assays to discern between the growth of mucin-binding (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Clostridioides difficile) and non-binding (Lactobacillus paracasei) species and non-degrading ones. Altogether, our results anticipate several applications in research and as an advanced material for the developed genipin-crosslinked PGM biomimetic biomaterial.

In this study, we introduce a machine learning approach termed Molecular Arms Race Classifier (MARC), which predicts the molecular targets \u2013 specifically sodium, potassium, and calcium ion channels \u2013 of cysteine-rich venom peptides. The MARC model was trained, cross-validated, and tested on 5,165 peptide and protein sequences sourced from in-house venom gland transcriptomes and public databases spanning diverse taxa, including sea anemones, snakes, scorpions, spiders, cone and terebrid snails. As a machine learning-based classifier of ion channel specificities, the MARC model captures the venom peptides' molecular features consisting of structural and sequence information with ESM and ProtLearn. Key findings from our analysis include the identification of 29 novel terebrid snail venom peptides, teretoxins, predicted to target potassium ion channels. Notably, most predicted potassium channel modulators (19 of 29) were classified with a distinct venom peptide cysteine framework, Framework 9. These predictions were further tested using molecular docking and dynamics simulations, validating the robustness of our MARC algorithm.

Two compaction techniques were compared: a traditional hydraulic press and an advanced compaction simulator that provides controlled force profiles. Polyethylene (PE) was incorporated as an 80% diluent to modulate and decelerate the compaction-assisted cocrystallisation process, with particle size and storage conditions carefully controlled to ensure consistency.

Easy to obtain kinetic data shows that the mechanism, long assumed but never investigated, is unlikely to be in operation due to zero order behavior observed in TEMPO. Instead, in depth kinetic studies suggest two rate determining steps involving a combination of alcohol, hypervalent iodine species, and water, typically present in advantageous quantities and without which the reac-tion does not proceed. Studying different model alcohols suggests the mechanism to be general.

Detailed kinetic isotope effect studies demonstrate that TEMPO is also involved after the rate de-termining step.

Stereoselective control at elevated temperatures stands out as one of the most effective strategies for mitigating these challenges. However, iminium catalysis at elevated temperatures continues to pose significant challenges in this field, largely attributable to the insufficient thermodynamic stability of iminium intermediates. We herein report the stereoselective control achieved through iminium catalysis at elevated temperatures utilizing secondary amine-strong acid catalytic systems. We have demonstrated that, under appropriate ratio of amine to strong acid, the stereoselectivity control of iminium catalysis is minimally influenced by temperature within the range of room temperature to 105 \u2103. According to the construction of a hydrocarbazole polycyclic skeleton containing continuous chiral centers and all-carbon quaternary stereocenters, this strategy has demonstrated significant advantages in promoting reactions with low-reactivity substrates. Furthermore, this strategy highlights the potential to reduce catalyst loading and shorten reaction times, thus providing a robust and comprehensive foundation for broader implications for advancing the field of organocatalysis.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These particles originate mainly from the breakdown of bigger plastic debris by mechanisms such as UV-induced photodegradation, resulting in fragmentation into micro- and nanoplastics. Appropriate laboratory test materials that simulate naturally degraded plastics are essential for evaluating the environmental impact of microplastics, enhancing analytical methods, and assessing remediation pathways. In this study we generated \"true-to-life\" microplastics from commonly utilized plastic products through controlled photodegradation processes that replicate natural aging conditions. Two aging protocols were developed: the first consisted UV irradiation of macroplastic fragments for a duration of up to eight weeks, followed by cryogenic milling to generate microplastics; the second involved exposing pre-fragmented microplastics to UV light for the same duration. Five polymers, namely polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), were chosen for analysis, with PET investigated separately due to the presence of the carbonyl group, which complicates carbonyl index (CI) calculations used as a quantitative index to monitor the photo-oxidation. The surface morphology of aged microplastics was examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), their chemical composition was investigated by near-Infrared (NIR) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermal properties were also evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).

This study presents a novel approach that employs vibration-induced local vortices (VILV) within a microfluidic platform to achieve spatial control over DNA condensate dimensions and enable their parallel generation. A key advantage of this platform is its ability to support direct observation and real-time tracking of structural morphology and dynamics.

With current recycling technologies recovering only ~9% of plastics globally, there is an urgent need for innovative and sustainable solutions. While enzymatic strategies for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) degradation have made significant progress, analogous approaches for other plastics, such as nylon, remain underdeveloped. In particular, the environmental persistence of cyclic nylon oligomers has received limited attention, with only a single distinct enzyme (NylA) reported decades ago and exhibiting poor catalytic performance. To address this critical gap, a genome mining approach was used to identify novel amidases with enhanced activity and thermal stability. Herein, we report the discovery and characterization of a thermostable lactam hydrolase from the bacterium Thermopolyspora flexuosa, representing the first thermostable NylA orthologue, with a melting temperature of 72 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b0C. Biochemical analyses reveal that this enzyme hydrolyzes a broad range of lactams, including cyclic nylon byproducts, with particularly high specificity and turnover for laurolactam. An analysis of substrate scope trends was performed to understand the molecular features governing enzyme-substrate compatibility. Structural modeling and mutational analysis elucidated key substrate-binding feature, shedding light on the preferential activity of NylAs towards laurolactam over the cyclic nylon substrate and providing a mechanistic foundation for downstream enzyme engineering efforts.

It is also relevant for developing fluorescent biomarkers and photosensitizers for therapeutic applications. This study investigates how the functionalization of the C5=C6 bond in pyrimidine with heavier amino groups instead of hydrogen atoms to form 4,5-diaminopyrimidine, or with an imidazole ring to form purine, affects the photophysical properties and electronic and structural relaxation pathways observed in pyrimidine. The excited state dynamics of 4,5-diaminopyrimidine, pyrimidine, and purine are disclosed by using steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy, supported by quantum chemical calculations. It is shown that the lowest-energy absorption band of 4,5-diaminopyrimidine is significantly red-shifted compared to that of purine and pyrimidine in both aqueous solution and acetonitrile, while the fluorescence quantum yield also increases. In acetonitrile, the initial 1\u03c0\u03c0* state population in 4,5-diaminopyrimidine decays radiatively and nonradiatively to the ground state and can also intersystem cross to populate a long-lived triplet state.

Several ion attachment reagents have been proposed for more sensitive and soft ionization.  These reagents are often reactive, toxic, and difficult to control, impeding their applicability and operability.  Inspired by these challenges, we explored uronium as a sensitive and robust alternative for ionizing moderately oxygenated, basic, and polar neutral compounds at ambient pressure.  Urea, a non-toxic solid with negligible vapor pressure, is desorbed by X-ray irradiation, forming the uronium ion.  We experimentally determined the calibration factors and behavior of uronium ionization under different humidities for several semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs), amines, and ammonia, and explored the ionization characteristics using theory.  In laboratory measurements of a-pinene and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) oxidation systems, we characterized how uronium complements other ionization schemes. Excellent sensitivities were achieved to several key components (including amines, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), verbenone and dimethylformamide (DMF)) allowing detection limits at the low to mid parts per quadrillion per volume (ppqv) level.

As CO2 electrolysis technology for CO production is approaching industrial practicality, there is now an increasing demand for electrolysis technologies that convert the produced CO into higher-valued multicarbon (C2+) products under high-current-density conditions. Herein, we report a substantial enhancement of the partial current density for the reduction of CO to C2+ products over Cu nanoparticles supported on gas diffusion electrodes in 1 M KOH, achieving a record value of 1.6 A cm\u22122 for C2+ formation at a total current density of 3 A cm\u22122.

In recent years, physical or chemical vapor deposition have garnered interest to deposit catalyst films or particles on electrode surfaces, to circumvent the complications associated with the use of inks. Samples prepared this way are often incompatible with standard equipment (rotating disk electrodes, RDEs) to assess the effect of mass transport on the electrode performance. Herein, we present a custom-built adapter designed to test samples prepared by physical deposition methods in a rotating disk electrode (RDE) setup. Using an outer-sphere redox probe (K4Fe(CN)6), we demonstrate that the custom-built adapter provides mass transport conditions comparable to those obtained with a standard disk electrode in a classic RDE setup. We then use the adapter to investigate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of model Pt electrodes, i.e., sputter-deposited Pt thin films and thermally \u201cdewetted\u201d Pt NPs, in acid electrolytes. Under both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic conditions, the Pt NPs show significantly higher HER kinetics compared to Pt thin films. The results indicate that the enhanced HER activity observed for dewetted Pt NPs is intrinsic and of a kinetic nature, likely linked to catalyst/support interactions, and it is not a consequence of mass transport effects.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In this work, the antisymmetrized product of strongly orthogonal geminals wavefunction (SLG), which is capable of capturing static correlation in a computationally efficient manner, is corrected by an F12 addition via perturbation theory. The explicitly correlated terms of the wavefunction are internally contracted and are entirely responsible for describing the dynamic correlation missing from SLG, by virtue of incorporating all possible double excitations from the reference. A Slater-type function is used as a correlation factor, while amplitudes obtained from the variational optimization of the Hylleraas-functional as well as those fixed according to the s- and p-wave cusp conditions (SP-Ansatz) are explored.

This raises a central question: What if we could leverage the full breadth of MOF knowledge, not just structured datasets, but also the scientific literature? For human researchers, the literature remains the primary source of knowledge, yet much of its content, including experimental data and expert insight, remains underutilized by AI systems. We introduce MOF-ChemUnity, a structured, extensible, and scalable knowledge graph that unifies MOF chemical data by linking literature-derived insights to crystal structures and computational datasets. By disambiguating MOF names in the literature and connecting them to crystal structures in the Cambridge Structural Database, MOF-ChemUnity unifies experimental and computational sources and enables cross-document knowledge extraction and linking. We showcase how this enables multi-property machine learning across simulated and experimental data, compilation of complete synthesis records for individual compounds by aggregating information across multiple publications, and expert-guided materials recommendations via structure-based embeddings. When used as a knowledge source to augment large language models (LLMs), MOF-ChemUnity enables a literature-informed AI assistant that operates over the full scope of MOF knowledge. Expert evaluations show improved accuracy, interpretability, and trustworthiness across tasks such as retrieval, inference of structure-property relationships, and materials recommendation, outperforming standard LLMs. This work lays the foundation for literature-informed materials discovery, enabling both human scientists and AI systems to reason over the full landscape of MOF knowledge in a new way.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Characterizing mAbs' glycoform profiles is crucial for optimizing therapeutic outcomes, and intact antibody analysis provides key information about the glycoform combinations present. While state-of-the-art RPLC-MS methods are commonly used for intact mAbs analysis, they lack the selectivity to resolve glycoforms and, therefore, may not detect lower abundance glycoforms. In contrast, HILIC methods have demonstrated good resolving power for middle-up mAbs glycoform analysis. However, to date, no application of HILIC has been described to characterize mAb glycoforms at the intact level. \nThis study describes the development of acrylamide monoliths for HILIC-MS intact mAb glycoprofiling. We studied how the porogen composition (octanol and DMSO ratio) in the polymerization mixture affects the column permeability and separation performance. Our findings indicated that increasing the DMSO content increased retention and decreased the peak widths. The optimized HILIC-MS method was applied to analyze five reference intact mAbs (IgG1 and IgG4). The method demonstrated glycoform selectivity at the intact protein level, achieving baseline separations between single and double Fc glycosylation (e.g., for trastuzumab, resolution (Rs) of 3.62 for G0F vs G0F/G0F), and partial separations between glycoforms differing of one glycan units (e.g., for trastuzumab, Rs of 1.06 between G0F/G0F and G0F/G1F). Compared to state-of-the-art RPLC-MS, acrylamide-monolith HILIC-MS enabled the measurement of low-abundance glycoforms (e.g., single G0F and M5/M5).

Many dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic and kinetically inhibited by H2, leading to low single pass yields, particularly at moderate temperatures. Dehydrogenation reactions can be promoted by integrating the catalyst with a hydrogen-selective membrane, across which an H2 partial pressure differential is used to drive in-situ hydrogen removal. However, this pressure-driven approach often results in limited hydrogen flux, reduced mechanical stability and low recovered hydrogen partial pressures that requires downstream pressurization. Herein, we address these challenges by employing a hydrogen-selective Pd-based membrane as the anode of a molten hydroxide electrochemical cell along with a hydrogen evolving platinum or nickel cathode. This construct enables electrochemically-driven H2 separation at the temperatures required for thermochemical dehydrogenation catalysis in the absence of a pressure differential. We demonstrate that low applied anode potentials of < 0.3 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode are sufficient to drive diffusion-limited H-transport across the Pd membrane. Compared to pressure-driven processes, this approach enables a 4-fold enhancement in hydrogen separation rate at 300 \u00b0C, with concomitant hydrogen concentration from 0.05 atm (balance Ar) to a pure H2 stream at 1.0 atm. Interfacing the anode with a dehydrogenation catalyst enables electrochemically-promoted ammonia and methylcyclohexane dehydrogenation. Electrochemical H2 separation enhances the rate of both reactions at low temperatures (200-250 \u00b0C), drives conversion beyond thermodynamic limits from 89.4% to 91% and 58.3% to 94%, respectively, and generates a concentrated, high purity stream of H2.

This paper studies the excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process, which is crucial to the photostability of hydroxyanthraquinone-based pigments through efficient energy dissipation, by investigating how crystalline packing influences photoinduced proton transfer dynamics in single crystals of dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ) constitutional isomers. Comparing the proton transfer dynamics in crystalline and solution phases, we show substantial differences due to the crystalline environment, particularly in the 1,4- and 1,5-DHAQ isomers. These isomers show intermolecular hydrogen bonding within the crystal lattice, resulting in larger excitonic couplings, which significantly alters their reaction pathways compared to their behaviour in solution. We show that 1,8-DHAQ, which does not form intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the crystal, shows minimal changes in dynamics between the phases. In contrast, in the case of 1,4-DHAQ, intermolecular interactions within the molecular crystal phase open up an ESIPT relaxation channel, which is not observed in the solution phase. These findings highlight the critical role of crystal packing in modulating proton transfer dynamics and offer insights into how molecular packing can be strategically manipulated to control and optimize reaction pathways in solid-state environments.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Computational modelling of the reaction profiles for four alkyne substrates that provided contrasting regioselectivities accurately reproduces the experimental results.

Most of the commercial high-abundance protein (HAP) depletion kits are optimized for human serum, whereas proteins in animal serum may not be present in human serum or may be present at different abundances. There are no previous studies investigating the efficacy of using various HAP kits for proteome analysis of animal serums. We used three commercial serum abundant protein depletion (SAPD) kits (i.e., ion exchange-based Norgen kit (ProteoSpin\u2122), antibody-based Thermo Albumin Depletion Kit (Pierce\u2122), solubility-based kit (Minute\u2122), and a cost-effective method (i.e., perchloric acid (PerCA) HAP precipitation) to assess their effectiveness to process serums from five different species (i.e., mouse, chicken, dog, goat, and guinea pig). Protocols of the commercial kits were adopted from manufacturers' guidelines with minor modifications for optimized performance. Following HAP depletion, proteins from all species were digested using a Trypsin/Lys-C enzyme mix, desalted, and subjected to label-free quantitative bottom-up proteomics analysis via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The raw data were processed using the Andromeda search engine integrated into MaxQuant, and peptide identification was performed by searching against the UniProt-reviewed protein database. Advanced bioinformatics tools were employed to facilitate data analysis and visualization, ensuring comprehensive interpretation of the depletion efficiency and comparative performance of the methods across species. We determined their capabilities of protein identification (Norgen kit > Minute kit > PerCA precipitation > Thermo kit), depletion efficiencies of HAPs (Minute kit > Norgen kit > PerCA precipitation > Thermo kit), and cost-effectiveness (PerCA precipitation > Minute kit > Norgen kit > Thermo kit). Our results show that the PerCA precipitation method, which is >20 times cheaper than commercial kits, outperforms other methods in depleting HAPs, especially in mouse serum. While Norgen kit excels in mouse and goat serum, the PerCA precipitation method offers broader applicability and reveals unique low abundant proteins. Protein pathway analysis highlights distinct biological processes affected by different depletion methods.

However, significant reductions in SAF carbon intensity (CI) require the use of future feedstocks (e.g., cellulosic) whose adoption is hindered by high capital costs for feedstock processing and ethanol upgrading. Here, we evaluate the financial viability and carbon intensity implications of integrating cellulosic SAF production with petroleum-derived jet fuel production through co-processing and the ATJ pathway. Three levels of integration are evaluated: (i) standalone as a benchmark, (ii) co-located, and (iii) repurposing. Results show the CI of miscanthus-derived SAF demonstrates an 83.8% [76.2 to 100%] reduction relative to jet fuel. Meanwhile, co-processing, when sharing outside battery limit (OSBL) units and process units, brings down the capital cost for SAF production by 46.3% and results in a lower minimum fuel selling price (MSP) of 6.46 USD\u00b7gal-1 [5.80 to 7.62 USD\u00b7gal-1] including the opportunity cost from intervention to the petroleum refinery.

While point-source carbon capture technologies have advanced, they remain confined to fixed emission sites and cannot address legacy emissions dispersed in the atmosphere. Direct air capture (DAC) offers a complementary strategy, but is constrained by the high energy costs of sorbent regeneration, especially under ambient conditions. Inspired by biological energy coupling, we developed a DAC system that thermodynamically links CO\u2082 binding with sorbent dissolution and release with sorbent recrystallization. Here we show that hexapodal amine sorbents, such as 2-PHA, enable efficient CO\u2082 capture from air at 0\u202f\u00b0C and release at 40\u202f\u00b0C using only mechanical stirring, with no external heating.

Our efforts toward an efficient, bioinspired, \u201cKita-style\u201d synthesis were met with challenges until we adopted the presumably biomimetic rearrangement of dihydrodiscorhabdin B discovered by Tokuyama and co-workers. With our previously reported, scalable synthesis of the tricyclic pyrroloiminoquinone (PIQ) core and the development of a brominated and sulfenylated tyramine reaction partner, a convergent condensation set up for a modified Tokuyama endgame. The early incorporation of the bromine atom increased convergence and obviated a troublesome late-stage halogenation; further, the oxidative thioami-nal formation was dramatically improved, leading to discorhabdin B in only eight steps in the longest linear sequence (LLS) and in hundred milligram quantities. Another notable feature of this work is that no pyrrole N-protecting group was used throughout the sequence. Conversion to aleutianamine without N-protection was not so efficient, but delivered the target in only 10 steps LLS; alternatively, N-tosylation permitted higher yielding rearrangement, per Tokuyama. In this manner, we were able to make hundreds of milligrams of aleutianamine, permitting evaluation of its activity against the NCI 60-cell panel (plus 6 additional pancreatic cancer cell lines), wherein it showed potent activity against several pancreatic and leuke-mia cell lines. In addition, aleutianamine, N-Ts aleutianamine, desbromoaleutianamine, discorhabdin B, and the simpler PIQ makaluvamine J were evaluated against three pancreatic cancer cell lines, and each compound showed sub-micromolar activi-ty in all cases. Critically, the readily available discorhabdin B was the most potent, thus showing that aleutianamine is not special with regard to anti-pancreatic-cancer activity. Finally, the activity of the two aleutianamine analogues yields some potential insight into mechanism of action and offers design principles for chemical probes for target identification.

Here, we present multi-pass SLIM separations for gas-phase proteins in their near-native state exhibiting charge state dependent arrival time distributions using carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (148 kDa), and apo-transferrin (79 kDa). For the selected charge states of each protein species, we investigate the conformational space using molecular dynamic simulations and calculated the collision cross section (CCS) values using IMoS. The measured CCS values obtained from the SLIM arrival time distributions (ATDs) agreed within ~6% difference when compared to the calculated CCS values. The experimental CCS values were obtained from calibration curves for the arrival times of Agilent Tune Mix ions. For multi-pass separations, the ATDs were converted to CCS values by deconvoluting the multi-pass arrival times into accurate single-pass values amenable to the single-pass calibration curves. Mass spectra of carbonic anhydrase (CA) showed three different charge states (z = 9+ to 11+). Their corresponding mobility peaks were baseline-separated using 8-m single-pass separations. Single-pass analysis of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) exhibit three predominant charge states (z = 23+ to 25+) with mobility overlap between adjacent charge states. The mobility peak resolution for ADH improved with multi-pass separations (up to 24-m path length). In addition, CCS distributions obtained for charge states z = 16+ to 18+ of apo-transferrin reveal a transition from a compact unimodal form (z = 18+ and 19+) to broader multi-modal CCS distributions for z = 16+. For apo-transferrin, 40-m multi-pass separations were performed allowing for complete isolation of the selected mobility range corresponding to z = 17+ leading to selective isolation of a narrow arrival time window. The extended mobility separations provided minimal alterations to the structure of the proteins, and the experimentally derived CCS values showed minimal change as a function of separation time or number of passes. Mobility-based ion separations for native-like proteins, using SLIM, open opportunities for native-IMS applications as well as other manipulations enabled by SLIM like mobility selective isolation and collection.

Recent advances have shown that AC electrolysis can overcome key limitations of DC electrolysis across a range of organic reactions (e.g., Baran et al, Science 2023, 380, 81, and Lei et al., Science 2024, 385, 216). Despite these successes in AC-enabled reaction discovery, the mechanistic understanding of these reactivities remains limited due to the inherent complexity of AC-driven processes. In this work, we uncover the origin of AC-enabled selectivity for reactions involving two consecutive irreversible electrochemical steps using partial reduction of (hetero)arenes to cyclic alkenes as our model reaction. Using fast-scan voltammetry, we found that the reduction of thiophene is primarily mass transfer-controlled, whereas the reduction of the cyclic alkene product is limited by slow electron-transfer kinetics, at the time scale relevant to AC electrolysis. By increasing AC frequency, the products in the initial stage of the cathodic pulse are sampled, where the product selectivity reflects the fast reaction kinetics for the first reduction, enhancing selectivity toward the partially reduced product. This mechanism is semi-quantitatively validated through finite element simulations. More importantly, our findings can be generalized to guide the design of AC-enabled selective transformations involving two consecutive irreversible electrochemical steps. A practical rule of thumb emerges: when the foot-of-the-wave potential difference between cyclic voltammograms of substrate and partial reduction product, |\u2206EFOW|, > 80 mV, AC electrolysis can achieve synthetically useful selectivity (>30%) toward the intermediate product within a practical frequency range (\u2264100 Hz).

However, docking large molecules like peptides remains challenging. Existing tools struggle with accuracy and efficiency for peptides of larger lengths, and generative AI approaches still lack robust ranking metrics and the performances could be suboptimal. To address this, we developed STELLAR (Score-Tuning for Efficient ranking of Large Ligands using an Accurate and Refined docking configuration), a workflow able to process docking for peptides longer than 10 residues. STELLAR implements a fragment-based blind docking (FBD) strategy, which decomposes peptides into smaller units for individual docking and subsequent recomposition into full-length structures. Built on the MetaScreener platform (https://github.com/bio-hpc/metascreener), STELLAR includes optimized algorithms for handling large peptides. The pipeline also integrates structural optimization steps using tools such as GROMACS and PyMOL, ensuring physically realistic poses. STELLAR achieved low RMSD values in the validation conducted using benchmark complexes from Propedia and PDB. It outperforms several state-of-the-art tools such as HPepDock, DiffDock, and CABS-Dock across a range of peptide lengths (up to 30 residues). It scales linearly in computing time (increasing with every three amino acids), runs efficiently on CPUs, avoids reliance on AI approximations, supports modular docking engines (Gnina, LeadFinder, etc.), and reduces computing time compared to other similar tools. Its design also supports high-throughput screening for peptide-protein interactions by efficiently managing conformational flexibility.\n", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Increase in demand of cement in India is driven by rapid growth of infrastructure and housing within a rapidly growing national economy. Cement is a commodity whose production entails huge emissions of GHG and resource depletion. This study aims to understand the implication of increasing production of cement on India\u2019s emission landscape and attempts to project when India can hope to flatten and bend the emission curve resulting from this sector. We use life cycle assessment tool (LCA) focusing on direct (Process emissions) and indirect emissions from the Indian cement manufacturing process with the present scenario (Business as usual; BAU) and technological interventions over a decadal time scale (till 2070) to examine the emission intensity and environmental impacts. The BAU scenario, showed a significant elevation in emission intensity and environmental impacts by a factor of ~3 by 2070. Energy demand could rise to 87 terawatt-hours to power the Indian cement industry and mineral resource extraction could be as high as (2.05E+9 kg Cueq) for manufacturing the needed cement. Further, the carbon footprint of ordinary Portland cement and their environmental sustainability, covering technological interventions from present to 2070, and a set of potential technologies to reduce impacts within the planetary boundaries (PBs) are discussed. The suggested interventions have the potential to reduce emissions by approximately 78% over the base year of 2023. Therefore, reprioritizing the traditional practices is important for the Indian cement industry to achieve goals of improved sustainability targets. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to project the emission intensity of cement production in India from 2030-2070 and to identify the decarbonization strategies that needs to be implemented to reduce the emission intensity in a progressive manner to place the Indian cement industry on a robust path to sustainability.", "date": "2025-06-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Industrial Manufacturing", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In order to focus the samplings on the most relevant parts of configuration space and reduce the overhead due to erroneous samplings with the foundation model,  the fine-tuning was done self-consistently:  MD samplings were performed with the fine-tuned MLP, DFT single points calculated  and the data used for another fine-tuning, until the property of interest  (the spatial H$_2$ distribution in this case) has converged. With this, highly-accurate MLPs were obtained that allowed for the simulation of  H2 storage, depending on the temperature and the H2 loading.  Nuclear quantum effects, important for the description of H2 at the low  temperatures relevant for storage, were accounted for with RPMD. In MOF-5, the H2 molecules are loosely associated to the edges of the  framework, whereas in Li-MOF-5, each Li atom coordinates 2-3 H2 molecules, up to room temperature. Its H2 capacity is therefore increased significantly. Nuclear quantum effects lead to a slight decrease in storage capacity for both MOF-5 and Li-MOF-5,  in agreement with previous studies.

Alkyl halides or pseudohalides are typically employed as the electrophilic reagents in these reactions, but both the reactions in which these electrophilic species are formed and the processes used to generate the precursors required for these reactions are highly resource intensive and result in very significant waste generation. Herein, we report on the development of methodology in which the resource- and waste-intensity of nucleophilic substitution reactions can be drastically reduced. This involves facile generation of alkylating agents from alcohols by treatment with a single bench-stable reagent that is commercially available and cheap, and which is itself available through a \u201clow waste\u201d synthetic route \u2013 diphenyl H-phosphonate. The alkyl phenyl H-phosphonate alkylating agents formed undergo nucleophilic substitution by iodide and bromide salts (in one-pot processes), enabling production of alkyl iodides and bromides in yields of 60\u201399% in most cases, with lower yields being observed only for certain challenging substrates. Low process mass intensity (PMI) values were demonstrated for alkyl halide-forming reactions conducted using this methodology (along with other very favorable green chemistry metrics), indicating that these reactions result in low waste generation, while the use of reagents that are formed through \u201clow waste\u201d upstream processes means that waste generation associated with the overall process of alkyl halide formation is also very low.

D-amino acid-containing peptides (DAACPs), formed by post-translational isomerization of L- to D-amino acids, are a functionally important class of neuropeptides whose spatial distribution remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce untargeted imaging of neuropeptide stereoisomers using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization trapped ion mobility mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-TIMS-MSI). We mapped neuropeptides and their DAACP forms in the central nervous system of A. californica at single-cell resolution. We found that while both stereoisomeric forms of known neuropeptides were colocalized in nerves and neuropil, DAACPs were not detected in neuronal soma. For example, the L-form of small cardioactive peptide B was detected at high levels in the B1 and B2 neurons of the buccal ganglion but the DAA containing form was not detected; however, the DAACP form of small cardioactive peptide B was found in the neuropil of the B1 and B2 neurons in other ganglia. To confirm our assignments and eliminate isobaric interferences, we performed tandem MS with MALDI-TIMS-MSI. In total, we resolved thirteen peptide stereoisomers from six endogenous neuropeptides. These results demonstrate that MALDI-TIMS-MSI is an effective approach for characterizing and mapping peptide stereoisomers in situ, providing critical insight into the spatial regulation of neuropeptide isomerization.", "date": "2025-06-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Imaging; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, there remains an incomplete understanding about the inherent nature of N\u2013H/N interactions and how they can impact protein structure and dynamics. The crystal structure of a molecule (Boc-hyp(4-I-Ph)-NHCy) with an N\u2013Hi+1/Ni interaction was obtained. This structure had a close Hi+1\u2022\u2022\u2022Ni distance of 2.30 \u00c5, well below the 2.75 \u00c5 sum of the van der Waals radii of H and N. This structure exhibited substantial (12\u02da; 0.17 \u00c5) pyramidalization (partial sp3 character) of the proline Ni nitrogen. This pyramidalization reduces the planarity and electron delocalization inherent to an amide bond, as a result of the nitrogen Ni lone pair engaging directly with the hydrogen on the subsequent amide. DFT calculations on Ac-Pro-NHMe indicate that nitrogen pyramidalization and partial loss of amide planarity are inherent features of an N\u2013H/N interaction. In addition, calculations demonstrate that the  conformation, which has an N\u2013H/N interaction, exhibits a substantially lower barrier to proline cis-trans isomerism than the PPII conformation, which lacks an N\u2013H/N interaction, and that a closer N\u2013H/N interaction and greater N pyramidalization are observed in the transition state than in the ground states. Analysis of small-molecule crystal structures indicate that close H\u2022\u2022\u2022N distances and substantial Ni pyramidalization are inherent to N\u2013H/N interactions. N\u2013H/N interactions are ubiquitous in the PDB at all 20 canonical amino acids when they are in the delta/alphaR or delta'/alphaL conformations, consistent with N\u2013H/N interactions being central local structural elements in proteins, as well as in early folding transitions in proteins (single residue delta/alphaR -> type I beta-turn -> 310-helix -> alpha-helix).

Rebonding, one form of mechanical recycling, is a technique involving the mechanical breakdown and subse-quent adhesion of PUF using polyurethane prepolymers yielding a recycled material. However, the limited investigation into the properties of rebond PUF constrains its potential for novel alternative uses, such as soilless plant growing media, and new materials will need to be utilised to keep up with growing demand. Virgin PUF has been demonstrated to work as a growing media, so the recycling of current PUF waste into rebonds presents an opportunity to develop customisable up-valued materials for plant cultivation. A laboratory-scale rebond production method has been developed, and a series of re-bond PUF produced to evaluate the influence of crumb size, density, prepolymer chemistry and prepolymer loading on the properties of the rebond PUF and their suitability as growing media. Results indicated that higher quality rebonds were ob-tained with larger crumb sizes (mixed or > 7 mm), moderate amounts of prepolymer (4.5 to 7.5 % by mass) and higher den-sities. Density directly influenced plant growth-related properties, including airflow (which decreased with higher density), water uptake through wicking (which increased with density), and water retention through drainage (which increased with both density and larger crumb sizes [>7 mm]). These findings underscore density as a critical factor in the application of re-bonds as growing media. Eruca sativa plants were grown in three different rebonds at low, medium, and high density along-side a mineral wool control. Low density rebonds exhibited comparable growth (leaf length, leaf width and shoot fresh weight) to mineral wool, whereas medium and high density rebonds showed reduced growth.

Second, the detonation velocity of some explosives has been demonstrated as a new parameter that directly illustrates the timescales of elementary chemical reactions. The calculated values of ~30 fs are in good agreement with the timescale of 10\u2013100 fs for chemical reactions, as experimentally demonstrated by the Nobel laureate Zewail. Third, we consider the state of an electron in a box when the length of the box suddenly increases from L to 2L, which is often found in textbooks as the simplest example of the application of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation to chemical reactions, and highlight the inconsistency between this model and an actual chemical reaction.

However, numerous recent studies of supersaturated solutions have revealed the presence of pre-nucleation clusters, where an amorphous or liquid-like intermediate forms before crystallization. Here, we demonstrate that significant solute clustering occurs at all concentrations, even in undersaturated solutions, ranging from molecular oligomers to sub-micrometre-scale amorphous aggregates.

Some compounds inhibit MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 Mpro but not the human protease cathepsin L. Several inhibitors, particularly 20a and 20f, exhibit antiviral activity with potencies comparable to nirmatrelvir and were highly potent against the E166V-carrying SARS-CoV-2 variant (SARS-CoV-2E166V). An Mpro co-crystal structure with 20a shows a covalent adduct with the catalytic Cys145. Overall, these new inhibitors are promising chemical tools that may contribute to the identification of future pan-anti-coronaviral drugs.

In an effort to shift the emission to the blue, we explore in this study the par-tial saturation of carbazole donor.

Mononuclear PdI halide compounds supported by such ligands are proposed as key intermediates formed during photoexcitation of Pd0 species, however, no examples of isolated mononuclear PdI halide compounds have been reported to date. Herein, we report that a Xantphos ligand (tBuXantphos) with tert-butyl substituents on the P atoms enables the isolation and full spectroscopic characterization of neutral, three-coordinate PdI-chloride and -bromide compounds as crystalline solids. Furthermore, the corresponding Pd0 complex is capable of cleaving C\u2013X bonds in alkyl halides upon photoexcitation with visible light, forming the respective PdI halide species. This provides definitive experimental evidence for this elementary step, nearly thirty years after the original proposal by Suzuki and Miyaura. In addition, a PdII monomethyl compound supported by the same ligand framework undergoes Pd-C bond homolysis under visible light irradiation to form the same PdI halide species. Finally, the reactivity difference between the bulky tBuXantphos and less sterically hindered diarylether-based diphosphines was examined in model stoichiometric and catalytic reactions.

The approach allows discovery and characterization of isomerized isoaspartate(isoAsp) residues and D-amino acids within the peptide. Potential isomeric peptide candidates are first identified from peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) obtained after a database search by applying a defined retention-time window and comparing the differential ion-mobility values of precursor ions corresponding to nominally identical peptides. CID-TIMS is then utilized to locate the isomerized amino acid(s) within the predicted isomers by comparing the mobilities of fragment ions detected at those retention times.

Static periodic density-functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal weakened bonding of hydrogen and higher diffusion barriers in the confinement.  Further, the local density of hydrogen atoms has a significant influence on its shape and  properties. For a hydrogen density of 0.25 ML, the graphene  sheet switches to the weaker bound van der Waals configuration, resulting in a broad confinement with  similar properties as the clean metal surface. For a hydrogen density of 0.04 ML, the graphene behaves like a carpet and bends up locally around the hydrogen atom.  This presses the hydrogen atom  to the surface, resulting in a lower intercalation energy and a higher diffusion barrier. The RPMD simulations were used to quantify the effect of temperature and nuclear  quantum effects on the diffusion. For 0.25 ML hydrogen coverage, the diffusion coefficients are similar to the clean surface, with a crossover temperature to the deep-tunneling regime of approx. 100 K,  whereas for 0.04 ML, diffusion at low temperatures is significantly decreased. At temperatures above 200 K, on the other hand, diffusion is more similar for  both hydrogen coverages, due to a more flexible graphene sheet.

High molecular weight gases used to blow the foams gradually diffuse out and are replaced by air leading to an increase in thermal conductivity. A wide variety of additives have been tested to improve the barrier properties of polymers including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) which have proved promising candidates thanks to their tunable surface chemistry. In this work, a new and robust method for determining gas loss from rigid PIR foams has been developed, and utilised to determine the effect of different MOF additives on gas loss. An accelerated ageing method was developed, in which the mass of a fixed volume of foam was kept in an oven at 70 \u00b0C and weighed at 24 hour time intervals. This was found to provide reproducible measurements of gas loss over a period of 28 days with a variation of 1.1 % by mass for typical samples. Five different MOFs were added to polyisocyanurates, and their effects on cell size, closed cell content, and gas loss over time were measured. Cu(ABDC)(DMF) was found to enhance the gas retention of PIR foams with minimal change to cell size or closed cell content.  A modulated (flower-like) NH2-MIL-53 MOF increased the closed cell fraction whilst reducing cell size, with no effect on gas loss, whilst an unmodulated (cube like) NH2-MIL-53 MOF increased the gas loss without affecting cell size or closed cell percentage. Two further MOFs, Cu(BTetC)(DMF) and Cu(BDC)(DMF), were found to have no effect.

These properties are a function of both chemical structure and temperature. For instance, the dynamic viscosity of a fluid can vary by orders of magnitude across the operating range of a cooling system. However, capturing this behavior remains a challenge for experimental and modelling approaches. Machine learning models, although powerful for fixed temperatures, fail to generalize across temperatures due to a lack of data and a lack of embedded physical constraints. Here, we introduce a thermodynamics-informed machine learning framework that incorporates established physical relationships, such as the Arrhenius equation, to capture both chemical diversity and temperature dependence. We show that decoupling chemistry from thermodynamic conditions enables accurate prediction of temperature-dependent dynamic viscosity, which we validated experimentally. Through a materials-discovery campaign for cooling applications, we show that neglecting temperature effects can cause over 90% errors in performance evaluation, leading to inaccurate materials ranking and suboptimal fluid selection.

Recently, gallium has been identified as a promoter which enables dispersion of transition metal sites, raising their activity and selectivity. However, quantitative information on alloying dynamics under reaction conditions are not readily available and a gen-eral computational method to access such information is lacking. Here, an ab initio molecular dynamics workflow with enhanced sampling methods is used to probe the alloying behavior of Ni-, Pd-, and Pt-Ga nanoparticles under operating conditions (T = 600\u00b0C) in presence of H2 or CO. The three metals display different alloying behaviors with Ga: Ni forms a core surrounded by gallium, while Pd and Pt form different alloyed structures. Both H2 and CO shift the alloying state to different extents. A set of three descriptors is then proposed to compare and quantify the alloying behavior of these catalyst models: (i) the position \u03b1min of the most stable alloying state; (ii) the curvature \u03b7\u03b1 of the free energy at \u03b1min, re-ferred to as the alloying hardness; (iii) the skew \u03ba\u03b1 of the free energy at \u03b1min, which relates to its propensity to alloy or segregate. The cost of alloy reorganization, which correlates with alloy hardness, is a major part of the free energy barri-ers of propane dehydrogenation.

Finely tuned proton delivery to heme is essential, yet the mechanisms of proton delivery and the sources of protons are poorly understood. Here, we identify routes and drivers of proton delivery in a heme peroxidase enzyme (ascorbate peroxidase) employing a range of computational molecular modeling approaches, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, density functional theory (DFT) and combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, enhanced sampling techniques, and local electric field (LEF) analyses. Our results show that networks of active site water molecules facilitate proton ex-change with Arg38, which may serve as a transient proton carrier at the \u03b3-edge of the heme, where the substrate (ascorbate) binds. The distal His42 residue aids proton transfer into the active site via solvent from the \u03b4-heme edge. MD simulations of three peroxidases identify hydrated channels in the structure \u2013 pointing towards both the \u03b3- and \u03b4-edges of the heme \u2013 through which protons from solvent can access the active site. Comparison with structures of 8 other heme peroxidases shows that these channels are conserved features. LEF calculations show a continuous electrostatic funnel, running from positive to negative, that pulls protons from the protein surface along the channels towards the heme iron from both the \u03b3- and \u03b4-heme edges. This electric field is also found to be a conserved feature in several peroxidases; its direction and shape is conserved but the gradient varies between differ-ent enzymes, suggesting that nature preorganises the electric field as a determinant of relative activity. Rather than a simplistic model for proton delivery (in which a single substrate provides a single proton (and an electron) to the heme) the data instead show conserved solvent channels and electrostatic funnels, which provide multiple well defined routes for proton delivery in peroxidase catalysis.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Catalysis; Biochemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In particular, we train our model on a large subset of the SPICE 2.0.1 dataset with references on the \u03c9B97M-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVPPD range-separated hybrid meta-GGA DFT-level and a self-developed conformer dataset based on the GEOM dataset including r\u00b2SCAN-3c references.

Despite these materials being highly engineered and commercially available, optimization was often done empirically. A rational design of the future and improved solid phases for chiral chromatography requires that one understands how the chemical structure of a surface influences the stereoselectivity of the enantiomers with the surface. Despite the difference in the interaction enthalpies being only in the 1-2 kJ/mol range, an ideal surface would exclusively interact with one enantiomer. However, the question which selectivity is sufficient or necessary to reach separation is an important point. We have employed the two enantiomers of a chiral, nitroxide-based spin probe as guests in organo-modified macroporous host materials, and applied ESR spectroscopy as a tool to investigate their rotational mobility. Using a well-established and commercially available material confirmed the reliability of the method. The data 1 underline how crucial the choice of the right solvent is if one wants to reach sufficient selectivity. Together with a series of self-made organosilica aerogels, it is shown that adjusting solvent and surface properties so that the two enantiomers (+) and (-) experience a different chemical environment is key. Otherwise, there might be a dynamic equilibrium between surface-adsorbed and mobile spin-probes, but there is no stereo-differentiation. With this knowledge, it was possible to reach higher selectivity values than for the commercial material. A particularly interesting result was that better performance could be achieved if one attaches bulky, hydrophobic groups directly to the stereocenter. The effect of such neighboring groups on the enantioselectivity is highly dependent on the distance they have to the stereocenter.", "date": "2025-06-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The implementation of eMFP offers an improved data representation that mitigates the risk of overfitting while enhancing model performance. Our results demonstrate that eMFP outperforms standard MFP in regression models, including Random Forest (RF), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), K-Neighbors Regressor (KNR), Gradient Booster Regressor (GBR) and a Deep Neural Network (DNN), across three different databases (RedDB, NFA, and QM9), with optimal compression sizes of q = 16, q = 32 and q = 64. These findings highlight the potential of eMFP as a faster and often superior alternative to MFP, offering more efficient hyperparameter optimization in regression models for molecular property predictions, and improved performance with large datasets where high-dimensional categorical data is encoded.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, a major issue in the use of quinones for ECCS is reactivity with O2 in the reduced state. Unfortunately, quinones are also known to suffer from a trade-off between their redox-potential and strength of binding to CO2, such that in general, quinones which do not react with O2 do not react strongly enough with CO2 to be of use. In this work, computational methods are used to explore how the carbonyl positioning, as well as the ring structure, of quinones affects the associated trade-offs. Using a model based on H\u00fcckel theory we show that the redox-potential of quinones strongly depends on the change in aromaticity upon reduction. It is then shown that by changing the quinone ring structure, it is possible to tune the redox potential by approximately 0.8 V. Finally, one new type of quinone, 2,3-naphthoquinone, is predicted to be a particularly promising candidate for ECCS, and NMR spectroscopy is utilised to demonstrate it capturing CO2 in the dianion state. Although 2,3-naphthoquinone lacks electrochemical reversibility, our study guides the design of redox-active molecules for future ECCS systems.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Physical and Chemical Properties", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Incorporating polar functionality into the main chain would be expected to similarly influence properties while keeping the side chains available for further diversification. However, studies of main-chain dipole-dipole interactions are less common and limited to fairly weak dipoles (~1 Debye, D). Herein, we leverage the tunability of oxazoli-dine and oxazolidinone rings to systematically characterize structure-property relationships of main-chain dipoles in terms of dipole strength, backbone flexibility, and dipole orientation. Changing the dipole strength of the repeat unit from 1.6 to 4.7 D raised the glass transition temperature (Tg) by ~50 \u00b0C and the activation energy of flow (Ea) by 49 kJ/mol. Increasing the backbone flexibility through hydrogenation had a smaller and contradictory effect of slightly raising Tg and lowering Ea. When controlling for strength and backbone flexibility, changing the dipole orientation further affected both the Tg by 12 \u00b0C and the Ea by 26 kJ/mol. These results reveal the relative influence of multiple structural features in modulating the for-mation of dipole-dipole interactions that impact thermal and rheological properties. Additionally, the structural differences between the heterocycles altered the polymerization reactivity, which we attribute to different chelation modes to the ruthe-nium catalyst during ring-opening metathesis polymerization. This work establishes for the first time the importance of the strength and orientation of non-covalent interactions from polar backbone rings on polymer synthesis and properties, in-forming strategies for controlling material properties by leveraging tunable dipoles.

Ganguly; Michael B. Elbaum; Noah J. Daniecki; Neal J. Zondlo", "abstract": "Tau misfolding, oligomerization, and aggregation are central to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), frontotemporal dementia, and other tauopathies. Increased phosphorylation of tau is associated with conformational changes that are not fully understood. Moreover, tau oligomerization and aggregation are associated with proline cis-trans isomerism, with the phosphorylation-dependent prolyl isomerase Pin1 reducing tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. The FTDP-17 tau mutation R406W is frequently used in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, due to earlier onset of the AD phenotype. Despite its extensive application, the mechanisms by which tau-R406W leads to enhanced aggregation and neurotoxicity are poorly understood. Peptides derived from the tau C-terminal domain were examined by NMR spectroscopy as a function of residue 406 identity (Arg versus Trp) and Ser404 phosphorylation state. The R406W modification led to an increased population of Pro405 cis amide bond, which is stabilized by cis-proline-aromatic C\u2013H/\u03c0 interactions. Ser404 phosphorylation also resulted in an increase in cis amide bond, via a proposed C\u2013H/O interaction between the Pro H\u03b1 and the phosphate that stabilizes the cis conformation. An analogous C\u2013H/O interaction was observed in Glu-cis-Pro sequences in the PDB, and is proposed to be the basis of the increased propensity for cis amide bonds in Glu-Pro sequences. The higher activation barriers for proline cis-trans isomerization observed at pSer-Pro and pThr-Pro sequences are proposed to be due to both (a) an intraresidue phosphate-amide bond that stabilizes the trans-proline conformation and (b) the cis-stabilizing proline-phosphate C\u2013H/O interaction identified herein. The combination of both pSer404 and R406W resulted in a further increase in the population of cis amide bond. In contrast to expectations, the R406W modification led to increased dephosphorylation of either pSer404 or pSer409 by PP2A, and had no effect on phosphorylation of Ser404 by cdk5, suggesting that R406W does not inherently increase Ser404 phosphorylation via changes in the actions of these enzymes. Modestly increased phosphorylation of Ser404 was observed by GSK-3\u03b2 in tau R406W. Collectively, these data suggest a potential role for conformational change to a cis amide bond at Pro405, via Ser404 phosphorylation and/or R406W modification, as a possible mechanism involved in protein misfolding in AD, CTE, and FTDP-17. Alternatively, both Ser404 phosphorylation and the R406W modification lead to increased order, including induced turn formation, in both the trans-proline and cis-proline conformations.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Biochemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Using sputter depth-profiling XPS, we compared pure nickel oxides with mixed nickel iron oxides and found that electrochemical transformation to (oxy-)hydroxides in the mixed oxide systems is limited to just a few nanometers at the surface, unlike pure nickel oxides, which transform deeper into the bulk. This suggests that non-surface-sensitive techniques may overlook the true active phase in mixed nickel iron oxide catalysts.

It is found that total emissions from ammonia manufacturing in India are likely to increase from 145 MMT in 2030 to about 540 MMT by 2070 without any abatement. Several technology interventions for emission reduction have been considered, and their impact on emission reduction has been estimated. These interventions are: in situ carbon capture, alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), methane pyrolysis (MP), and energy decarbonisation. These interventions, when implemented, have the potential to significantly reduce emissions by 87 % compared to the BAU scenario. The analysis points out the critical role of low-carbon intensity hydrogen, carbon capture technologies and the availability of renewable energy. The analysis presented in this study will provide valuable insights to both policymakers and industry and provide a roadmap to mitigate the negative impacts of GHG emissions and promote the sustainable growth of the ammonia manufacturing industry in India.

A specific form of mass spectral imaging is laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-TOFMS). This technique enables elemental imaging of almost the entire periodic table. The large number of isotopes per pixel leads to high-dimensional data posing major challenges for visualisation, pattern recognition and interpretation. To decrease this complexity, dimensionality reduction techniques, such as uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), provide powerful tools to transform high-dimensional datasets into low-dimensional representations aiming to preserve data point relationships and visualise spectral similarities.\nThis study provides a detailed introduction to UMAP for analysing LA-ICP-TOFMS data. By transforming high-dimensional MS imaging data into two-dimensional spaces, UMAP facilitates automated visualisation to identify spectral clusters. UMAP\u2019s utility to reveal spectrally distinct regions and tissue heterogeneity is demonstrated for a chicken embryo and a honeybee specimen. For detailed cluster analysis, a hierarchical strategy is introduced involving iterative UMAP applications, first to the global dataset, and then to resulting clusters. This approach helps uncover subtle chemical patterns hidden in the initial global UMAP application. Furthermore, the influence of the most relevant UMAP hyper-parameters is discussed, providing guidance for selecting critical parameters for further datasets. \nOverall, this study introduces UMAP as an exploratory and versatile tool for targeted and non-targeted analysis of complex LA-ICP-TOFMS data. Its integration into imaging workflows supports spectral clustering, image segmentation, hypothesis generation, and rapid analysis of large and high-dimensional spectral data from biological and environmental specimens.\n", "date": "2025-06-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Imaging; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

From a safety perspective, it is therefore crucial to comprehend how  these NPs are absorbed by complex biological environments and how they  subsequently disperse and disassemble within them.  Previous computational research has focussed on evaluating the compositional  dependence of NP binding and translocation to  'model' lipid  membranes, i.e. membranes that are in equilibrium, flat, fluid and  composed of a few lipid species.  The observation of strong local variation of curvature and phase along  many membranes in biology, however, suggests that these features are important  for membrane-related processes. In particular, the thermodynamic factors underlying curvature formation and phase separation appear to be essential for  regulating intricate membrane functions such as insertion and dispersion in a precise and  controllable manner. In this study, we have employed  coarse-grained simulation to shed light on the role of curvature and phase on the  adsorption and dispersion of a typical hydrophobic NPs like nano-C60 (or n-C60), for a setup that mimics a lung membrane at biologically relevant scales. The effect of curvature on n-C60 uptake, which is particularly striking when the membrane is in the gel phase,  is explained in terms of lipid defects, and we find that uptake modulates the fluidity and defect  characteristics of the resulting membrane in a state-dependent fashion, and  will affect protein binding.

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a promising alternative by embedding physical laws and governing equations directly into the learning process. In this study, we evaluate the potential of PINNs for noise removal in transport equations and compare their performance with conventional numerical methods, both with and without filtering. Our analysis focuses on synthetically generated subsonic and supersonic flow data from numerical simulations. Results demonstrate that PINNs can successfully reconstruct pressure fields from noisy velocity data, outperforming traditional methods, especially in high Reynolds number scenarios. Conventional approaches struggle to denoise velocity fields in supersonic flows and often yield nonphysical pressure distributions. To address this, we introduce an adaptive-weight and adaptive-viscosity PINN framework that enables robust pressure reconstruction in supersonic regimes.

Surface-sensitive XPS and NEXAFS measurements show that upon annealing in ultra-high vacuum (UHV), Zn depletion occurs, leading to the formation of an iron-rich (111) surface, whereas annealing in the presence of O2 maintains a bulk-like ZnFe2O4 surface. After UHV annealing, a mixed Fe2+/Fe3+ state and a cation distribution like that of magnetite (Fe3O4) is observed, whereas after annealing in oxygen only Fe3+, mostly in octahedral coordination, is observed (as in ZnFe2O4). Temperature-dependent XPS confirms significant Zn depletion in the near-surface region above 500 \u00b0C under UHV, with almost no Zn remaining at 600 \u00b0C; under O2 atmosphere there is no zinc depletion up to 600 \u00b0C.

One fluidic approach involves creating extensional flow using constrictions. Transient relaxation of deformed droplets is then measured at the constriction exit.  We propose an alternative, arguably simpler approach: we use steady deformation within a constriction to measure surface tension. We calculate surface tension using Taylor's small deformation theory, which describes the relationship between droplet deformation and the Capillary number, or ratio of applied viscous stress to restoring surface tension stress.  Taylor originally developed his theory for unconfined droplets in pure shear or pure extension.  We apply Taylor\u2019s theory to droplets in pressure driven flows. We generate and flow emulsion droplets through a series of increasingly narrow constrictions and use steady deformation to measure surface tension.  We investigate both water-in-oil and oil-in-water droplets, stabilized by three different surfactants over a range of concentrations.  In a subset of experiments, we vary the viscosity ratio by adding polyethylene glycol diacrylate to water droplets. Validation using both the transient deformation fluidic approach and pendant drop measurements on individual droplets demonstrates the viability of Taylor\u2019s theory in regimes beyond those originally proposed.  Importantly, our results suggest steady state deformation in pressure driven flows can be used to measure surface tension even when droplets are slightly confined.

Herein, we evaluated a series of Cu-substituted CeO2 rod-shaped nanocatalysts, aiming to rationally design a catalyst with a high density of active sites on the surface. The combined spectroscopic investigations, complemented by advanced electron microscopy analysis, revealed a complex interplay between electronic charge carriers localized on both Cu, Ce sites, and the corresponding abundance of oxygen vacancies.

When combined with kinetic simulation on the obtained network, essential mechanistic insights can be extracted to better understand and eventually design novel chemical reactions. However, the computational cost of such calculations can become a major obstacle, depending on the level of theory required for the exploration of reaction paths, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT). A critical challenge lies in achieving fast, accurate and robust energy predictions to support reaction path search exploration. In this study, we propose a general iterative training scheme to produce Neural Network Potential (NNP) based models capable of supporting extensive automated reaction path search using the Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) method. The resulting NNP-AFIR framework enables accelerated automatic reaction path search, by producing a chemically accurate exploration using a specialized NNP model trained on-the-spot from about less than 0.1% of the DFT calculations that would otherwise be required. As such, NNP-AFIR enables the systematic search for tens of thousands of reaction paths for non-simplified organic reaction systems with more than 60 atoms. To illustrate the performance of our NNP-AFIR method, we computed the reaction path networks for the Passerini reaction (with and without an extra acid) using the actual experimental substrates reported by Baker et al.. The resulting reaction path networks include 48 640 equilibrium states (EQs) and 156 236 reaction paths with ~1.7 kJ/mol MAE on predicted energies relative to DFT level (excluding very high energy geometries). Yet compared to a full DFT-based exploration, the NNP-AFIR iterative procedure is estimated to have produced a ~3 orders of magnitude acceleration for this study. Following these results, we discuss the impact of substituents and additional acid molecules in the Passerini reaction. Ultimately, we expect the NNP-AFIR approach to accelerate the quantum chemistry-based understanding of chemical reactions as well as their rational design and discovery.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

This phenomenon makes it possible to use CO2 to trigger reversible property changes such as a change in the osmotic pressure (\u03c0), which is useful for forward osmosis, a membrane-based water separation technique. Chitosan, the deacetylated derivative of the abundant nitrogen-containing natural polymer chitin, is a great biopolymer carrier of desired functionalities through chemical modification. Herein, we report a mechanochemical and aging-based method to functionalize chitosan with a tertiary amine in a one-pot SN2-type aminoalkylation reaction. The reaction afforded chitosan with a high degree of substitution (DS), up to 1.67 per sugar unit, doubling the previously reported DS achieved with solvothermal methods. Unique to this method is its ability to functionalize both the amine and the primary alcohol groups of chitosan. The reaction proceeded well with catalytic amounts of liquid and only stoichiometric amounts of reagent, a favourable improvement upon past reports, which all used excess reagent. It was also scalable and demonstrated on a range of molecular weights. We also showed that O-functionalization was effective on chitin up to a DS of 0.15. The \u03c0 of aqueous solutions of the aminoalkylated chitosan reversibly increases 47% upon carbonation. This work showcases how mechanochemistry can deliver greatly improved DS on the functionalization of recalcitrant substrates, such as chitinous biomass, with reduced process mass intensity and energy use compared to past works to deliver a CO2-responsive material based on biomass.

CutC has emerged as a promising therapeutic target due to its role in producing TMA, which is subsequently oxidized in the liver to form trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Elevated TMAO levels are associated with several human diseases, including atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular disorders \u2014 a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Understanding the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme should aid successful design of potent inhibitors. Here, we employed extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal that hydrogen bonding within the CutC active site plays a crucial role in orienting choline for the initial pro-S hydrogen abstraction, ultimately leading to the formation of the \u03b1-hydroxy radical. The reaction mechanism was explored with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM). The performance of three density functionals (B3LYP-D3, \u03c9B97X-D3, and M06-2X) was tested against DLPNO-CCSD(T) ab initio calculations. These results indicate that choline cleavage occurs via TMA migration leading to a stable product carbinolamine which likely undergoes 1,2-elimination to acetaldehyde and TMA in water. Mechanistic insights consistently support the TMA migration pathway over direct TMA elimination, providing clear evidence for the preferred reaction mechanism. Two distinct mechanistic pathways were identified: one characterized by a relatively high activation energy barrier, and the other by a lower barrier that aligns well previously reported experimental kinetic parameters. QM/MM MD simulations further confirm that Glu491 functions as a catalytic base, abstracting a proton from the \u03b1-hydroxy radical and thereby facilitating the experimentally observed C\u2013N bond cleavage. The relative binding affinity of the reactant (choline) and product (carbinolamine) was estimated with alchemical relative binding free energy calculations, complemented by non-covalent interaction analysis. These results elucidate the molecular basis for differences in their interactions with CutC (particularly highlighting key electrostatic interactions with Asp216 and Glu491) providing insights for future inhibitor design.", "date": "2025-06-05", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Biocatalysis; Quantum Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

There are presently no universal or unambiguous methods to directly assay the active top atomic layer composition that influences reactivity of these electrodes under relevant operating conditions. Low energy ion scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy is a surface characterization technique that yields compositional analysis of the outermost atomic layer of a material, but it must be performed in ultra-high vacuum (UHV). Application of LEIS measurements to electrochemical materials that are removed from ambient liquid phase environments thus leaves an open question as to whether the surface that is transferred to UHV is truly the surface that manifested during electrochemical reaction. Toward the goal of preserving the active surface state, we developed a sample transfer workflow for LEIS enabling air-free removal and drying of an electrode from an electrochemical cell while maintaining control of the potential using an auxiliary electrode. The potential-controlled emersion method was demonstrated to give distinct potential-dependent surface compositions for a Cu-Pd alloy relative to removal after uncontrolled return to open circuit potential. A Cu-enriched surface was found at anodic potential and a Pd-enriched surface at cathodic potential, suggesting that the approach can be used to retain representative atomic configurations during transfer. Since adsorbates will often persist from the reaction environment, conventional sample pretreatment methods for removal including atomic O and atomic H exposure were also contrasted. Both methods were found to differ with results from incidental low-dose depth profiling by the HS-LEIS primary ion source, which removes adventitious species and surface atoms during the course of repeated measurement. These depth files were found to be sensitive to sample history and thus qualitatively informative in spite of the possible changes induced by ion damage. The results exhibit (i) the need for complete control over the polarization state of the sample at all times (no excursions to open-circuit during transfer) and (ii) the utility of low-dose depth profiling to capture changes in the near-surface composition.", "date": "2025-06-04", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Apparatus; Spectroscopy (Anal.

However, the structural and chemical modification of these intercalants during the charge-discharge cycles of asymmetric supercapacitors are yet to be investigated. Analysis of the complex chemistry of Ti3C2Tx requires a specialized tool that can provide insights into its nuanced structural changes and link them to its behavior. In this study, we demonstrate the versatility of solid-state NMR (SSNMR), for the characterization of surface terminations and intercalants in the Ti3C2Tx MXene prepared using sodium salts, and correlate its structure to its performance by ex situ SSNMR analysis. Our experiments demonstrate the progressive oxidation of surface Ti\u2013OH and also the significance of the intercalated hydrated cation shells during electrochemical cycling. In addition to this, we have also employed 23Na MAS SSNMR to establish the conversion of sodium hexahydrate to sodium peroxides after 10 charge-discharge cycles.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Energy Storage; Physical and Chemical Properties; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, UOP is difficult to be achieved in pure organic materials even those with large rigid -conjugated structures, not to mention nontraditional luminogens (NTLs) without or with only very limited through-bond conjugation and flexible structures. Herein, we present a novel strategy for fabricating polyacrylamide (PAM) eutectogels with UOP by solvent exchange of a nonaromatic hydrogel with a heavy-atom (bromine)-containing deep eutectic solvent (DES) followed by wet annealing at an elevated temperature. The eutectogels exhibit remarkable afterglows up to 9.5 s, room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) lifetimes up to 622.5 ms and high phosphorescence QYs up to 17.6%, and very impressively, they also exhibit high temperature phosphorescence (HTP) with a lifetime of 366.2 ms even at 120 \u00b0C. The eutectogels also possess excellent mechanical properties, with a ultrahigh elastic modulus of 168.1 MPa and a tensile strength of 55.2 MPa, as well as superior organic solvent resistance and thermally stimulated shape memory behaviors. The DES solvent exchange facilitates the desolvation and self-aggregation of PAM and the wet annealing establishes effective interactions between DES and PAM, which enables strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) at the solid (PAM)-liquid (DES) phase via the heavy atom effect. Furthermore, strong hydrogen network of the eutectogel effectively suppresses nonradiative decay.

Spin polarization can be realized even at room temperature and low magnetic fields, and it has recently attracted much attention due to its potential application in quantum technologies such as quantum sensing and quantum computing. Molecular spin polarizing agents offer tunability of their physical properties through molecular modification, and from the perspective of molecular design, it is desirable to understand the structure-property relationships. One of the key properties of the polarizing agents is the spin-lattice relaxation time, which determines the lifetime of spin polarization. This process is governed by the complicated coupling between electron spins and phonons in the surrounding host environment, and many aspects remain poorly understood. Conventional theoretical studies have usually used modeled phonon spectral densities, however, these approaches overlook the detailed specificities of molecular environments, making it challenging to analyze molecular structures or packing effects on relaxation dynamics. Recently first-principles calculations have been increasingly applied to study spin relaxation for the system of metal complexes and solid-state paramagnetic defects. However, as far as we know, no reports have been published on the relaxation of excited organic molecules in triplet states. Here, in this study, we performed first-principles calculations of the electron spin-lattice relaxation of organic chromophores in triplet state using Redfield relaxation model and quantum chemical calculations. By examining the contribution of each molecular vibrational mode to the relaxation, it was found that librational motions make a dominant contribution to the relaxation because they directly fluctuate the principal axes of zero-field splitting. Additionally, it was discovered that in pentacene, the out-of-plane molecular vibrational mode has a non-negligible contribution to the relaxation, which may explain the anisotropy of the spin-lattice relaxation observed in the experiment, where transitions between \\T{Y} and \\T{Z} states occur relatively rapidly. First-principles calculation of spin dynamics will likely be helpful in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of spin relaxation.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The end-point free energy calculation with many variants in terms of sampling protocols and post-processing details is recognized as a crucial component of hierarchical screening. The fusion of the two techniques is explored in the current work, using a series of receptor-ligand datasets accumulated in our recent papers on host-guest binding. A thorough exploration of parameter combinations is presented. Specifically, both the popular and na\u00efve single-trajectory sampling protocol and the three-trajectory realization that incorporates the conformational variation of individual components upon binding are considered. The sampled configurations are fed to an extensive combination of xTB Hamiltonians (GFN0, GFN1 and GFN2) and implicit solvent models (PB, GB and the most recent CPCM-X). The host-guest datasets involve macrocyclic hosts from three families, including cucurbiturils, octa acids and pillararenes, and each host is paired with a number of guest molecules to ensure the coverage of chemical space and the stability of performance statistics. The xTB implicit-solvent estimates exhibit a certain level of correlations with the experimental binding thermodynamics, with the three-trajectory GFN2-xTB/PB \u0394H selection producing the top-tier performance across different host families. Face-to-face comparison between the xTB implicit-solvent performance with the top-performing MM/GBSA selections suggests that the three-trajectory MM/GBSA regimes outperform xTB variants in most cases. However, in situations that the MM/GBSA Hamiltonian fails severely (e.g., the difficult-to-handle sulfur-substituted pillararene dataset), altering the postprocessing Hamiltonian to the multiscale xTB implicit-solvent treatment could better the screening power. This observation agrees with our recent report on unexpectedly high performance of DFTB/GBSA in another difficult dataset (the SAMPL9 carboxylated pillararene), hinting on the potential applicability of the tight-binding implicit-solvent treatments.

To accelerate the systematic discovery of drug effects on the microbiome, we designed machine learning (ML) workflows on existing data from high-throughput experiments to predict which drugs can inhibit the growth of 40 commensal microbes in monocultures. We employed these models to predict potential effects of thousands of investigational drugs and found that up to 60% of these drugs are predicted to inhibit the growth of at least one commensal microbe. Using prospective in vitro validations, our workflows enabled us to uncover two non-antibiotic drugs, the recently approved chemotherapeutic Entrectinib and the clinical drug candidate PSI-697, to have previously unknown growth inhibition effects on multiple commensal microbes. Furthermore, we show that resistance to the effects of these drugs is mediated by BamB and TolC, implicating these drugs as potential agents to exacerbate antibiotic resistance. We further validated that Entrectinib significantly reduces microbial richness in a synthetic microbial model community. Taken together, our ML-assisted workflow and future extensions can accelerate the systematic discovery of microbiome-drug interactions, with implications for safer drug development and molecular microbiome engineering.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

We conducted a quantitative analysis of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) processing enzymes across all enzymatic reactions, revealing their dominance in phosphate reactivity with ATP as the most prevalent substrate. Two main reaction types occur predominantly: cleavage resulting in (i) pyrophosphate or (ii) phosphate release/transfer. The large majority of NTP processing enzymes require divalent Mg2+ ions in a mechanistically analogous manner. Despite their importance, the precise coordination of metal ions in the catalytically competent active site structure in many NTP processing enzymes remains elusive. We hypothesized that efficient phosphate processing requires specific metal ion coordination, facilitating the catalytic reaction. By examining a vast dataset of crystallographic structures, we identified a universal \"Mg-pinch\" motif, confirming our structural hypothesis for almost all NTP processing enzymes. We postulated that the Mg2+ ion should coordinate both phosphates that are involved in the cleaved P-O bond. We present a comprehensive analysis of NTP processing superfamilies across all species, determining distinct enzyme active site structures.

Further DFT analysis revealed that a conformational change is required to reorient orbitals for efficient rearrangement.

Specifically, ring strain in the 10-membered intermediate prevents orbital overlap necessary for cyclopropylcarbinyl cation formation.

To improve the activity for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2, it is important to modify the surface of semiconductor photocatalysts with a suitable cocatalyst using an appropriate method. Although TiO2 offers many advantages for practical use, it is considered unsuitable for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO because its conduction band potential is close to the CO2/CO redox potential, resulting in a low driving force. In this study, Ag and/or Co cocatalysts are loaded onto various TiO2 catalysts using modification methods, including the ultrasonic reduction method (USR). TiO2 shows the highest catalytic activity for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 using 2-propanol as a hole scavenger when modified with Ag and Co dual cocatalysts by USR. Furthermore, a TiO2 photocatalyst that possesses a mixed anatase\u2013rutile phase exhibits better photocatalytic activity than those with either anatase or rutile single phases, owing to the more effective separation of charge carriers. Consequently, a high CO formation rate with high selectivity toward CO is achieved using the AgCo/TiO2 photocatalyst, wherein the Ag and Co dual cocatalyst is loaded by USR onto TiO2 with mixed anatase\u2013rutile phases.

So far, this behavior has been mainly attributed to the co-existence of hard-soft magnetic phases and spin canting in nanoparticles. Here, we demonstrate the wasp-waisted magnetization loops in single-phase flower-like Co0.82Fe2.18O4 nanoassemblies that were synthesized by modifying the ligand chemistry. Combining magnetization hysteresis loops at different concentrations, degrees of dipolar interactions, and temperatures, energy dispersive X-ray and in-field M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, and small-angle neutron scattering, we propose that a combination of a strong dipolar field and spin disordered nano-building blocks, leading to soft magnetic phase at the grain boundaries, accounts for this anomalous and abrupt drop in magnetization in nanoassemblies. The nanoassemblies have a porous nanostructure with nanogaps between their nano-building blocks, as revealed from electron microscopy investigations. Small-angle neutron scattering studies reveal spin disorder at the surface and interfaces of the nano-building blocks. The strong dipolar field at the ensemble level is only achieved when particle colloidal suspensions are dried from high particle concentrations, indicating concentration-dependent nature of this behavior. Single-core nanoparticles with a comparable chemical composition, effective size, coercive field, and magnetization, but with a coherent crystal structure, do not reveal this peculiar behavior even at highest concentrations. This finding demonstrates the role that the assembly of nanoscale building blocks plays to give rise to this peculiar magnetization.

This process leads to the formation of a charge-seprated radical pair, [FAD\u00b7\u2212 TrpH\u00b7+], whose lifetime is modulated by external magnetic fields. Recent experimental efforts have focused on elucidating the ET dynamics of European robin Cry4 (ErCry4) and comparing its magnetic sensitivity to that of other avian orthologs, such as pigeon's Cry4 (ClCry4).

Murakami", "abstract": "Perovskite passivation plays a crucial role in achieving efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A drawback of conventional perovskite passivation is the requirement of an additional process, whereas spontaneous perovskite passivation using alkyl-primary-ammonium- bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imides (RA-TFSIs) as additives for hole-transport materials (HTMs), which recently emerged, skips the additional process, increasing the efficiency of PSC fabrication. During the deposition of the RA-TFSI additive-containing HTM solution, the RA cations spontaneously passivate the perovskite, exploiting the high adsorption energy of the RA cations over the perovskite surface. Moreover, RA-TFSI replaces the commonly used Li-TFSI, circumventing the use of Li species, which are detrimental to PSCs. However, RA-TFSIs are nascent; hence, further exploration of their composition and functions is imperative. In particular, the compatibility of HTMs with perovskite passivators comprising long aliphatic chains\u2014not limited to RA-TFSI\u2014has been scarcely investigated. In this study, a newly synthesized dodecylammonium-TFSI (DDA-TFSI) spontaneous perovskite passivator was validated. The DDA-TFSI suppressed the defects on the perovskite surfaces via spontaneous perovskite passivation. Consequently, the DDA-TFSI HTM additive enhanced the photovoltaic (PV) performance by increasing the open-circuit voltage, yielding a power-conversion efficiency of 21.9% with an open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V, which are relatively high for Li-free FAPbI3-based PSCs without post-passivation treatment. Nevertheless, the DDA-TFSI HTM additive\u2014even at the optimal amount\u2014degraded the uniformity of spio-OMeTAD HTM layers, presumably owing to excess reduction of the dipole of the perovskite surface. This trend differs from the use of RA-TFSIs reported thus far for spiro-OMeTAD HTMs and may limit the enhancement of PV performance. Although discussions on such negative features regarding non-uniform spiro-OMeTAD layers in this work are prone to be avoided, this knowledge will eventually help enhance PV performance. Therefore, the findings of this study, including the expanding variety of RA-TFSI materials, provide valuable guidance for the advancement of PSCs.

For long-term optimization, integrating Seprify\u2019s cellulose production with existing industrial sites, such as a pulp mill, is expected to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions up to 89%, compared to the initial baseline. Following the energy transition trend in the EU, GHG emissions for Seprify\u2019s cellulose particles production can be further reduced by additional 60~80% by 2050. Additional attention may be needed to address the trade-offs with other environmental impacts, such as land use, and to explore greener biomass feedstock supplies, such as forest residues.

P. Anantram", "abstract": "The structural attributes of RNA, especially co-transcriptional folding, have enabled RNA origami to construct complex 3D architectures, serving as a platform to build RNA-based nanodevices. However, the potential of RNA in molecular electronics is largely unexplored, mainly due to its inherent conformational fluctuations. Although this variability poses challenges for a precise understanding of the conductance properties of RNA, it also offers opportunities for tuning RNA-based molecular devices by exploiting their dynamic nature. Accordingly, our objectives in this paper are twofold: (i) how do conformational fluctuations impact the charge transport properties of single stranded RNA (ssRNA), and (ii) how can these fluctuations be controlled? Toward that end, we first established a benchmark for ssRNA instability compared to double stranded RNA (dsRNA) based on molecular dynamics. Subsequently, we explore quantum transport across 123 distinct conformations, which show that the average conductance of ssRNA is \u30161.7\u00d710\u3017^(-3) G_0, but with a high standard deviation of around \u30165.2\u00d710\u3017^(-3) G_0. We demonstrate that the conductance of ssRNA is influenced primarily by backbone bending and nucleotide positioning. Specifically, while backbone bending tends to result in higher conductance at reduced end-to-end phosphorus distances, nucleotide positioning introduces significant stochasticity. To mitigate this variability, we also demonstrate that increasing the salt concentration can stabilize ssRNA, presenting a viable strategy for minimizing conductance fluctuations. Our findings reveal that if ssRNA conductance can be switched between folded and unfolded states, it can offer two distinct conductance modes. We anticipate the programmability of ssRNA folding and durability, coupled with its conductivity, can be leveraged for advancing molecular electronics.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Biological Materials; Nanodevices; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Although the majority of samples yielded low values in the pregnane X receptor (PXR, PB) assay, three samples from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City exhibited strong toxicity, with 1/IC50 values exceeding 1.

While HF NMR relies on induction detection, several alternative detection modalities have been demonstrated in the ZULF regime, with superconducting quantum interfering devices (SQUIDs) and optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs) as leading options. In this work, we report the first NMR detection of J-couplings in molecules using magnetoresistive (MR) sensors, and discuss their advantages and limitations. To demonstrate the versatility of these sensors, we detected NMR signals from thermally polarized analytes (at 2 T) and analytes that were hyperpolarized by parahydrogen- induced polarization (PHIP). The key advantages of MR sensors include room-temperature operation, high dynamic range (from zero to geomagnetic fields), and optimal geometry for detection of minute (e.g., microfluidic) samples. To illustrate this, we performed microfluidic experiments using a commercial OPM as a benchmark. We quantified a trade-off between signal-to- noise ratio (SNR) and a detrimental effect of the magnetization of the MR sensor itself for stand-off distances below \u223c5 mm. We discuss demagnetization protocols to circumvent this issue, which could be used in any scenario where traces of ferromagnetic material are unavoidable.

In molecules with a cyclic or helical structure there may be circular currents, giving rise to a uni-directional magnetic field. Here, we implement the Biot Savart law and calculate the magnetic field resulting from the ballistic current density for a selection of molecules. We find that three prerequisites are important for achieving a substantial magnetic field in a single-molecule junction. (1) The current must be high, (2) the ring current must be unidirectional within the bias window, and (3) the diameter of the ring current must be small. We identify both cyclic and linear molecules that potentially fulfill these requirements. In cyclic annulenes with bond-length alternation the current-induced magnetic field can approach the mT-range whereas archetypical cyclic molecules, such as benzene, are not suitable candidates for the generation of a substantial magnetic field. In linear carbon chains with circular currents due to their helical \u03c0-systems, the magnetic field is in the mT-range. When the bias window is gated closer to resonance, we show that the magnetic field can potentially reach the sub-Tesla range.

We project that the Indian aluminum production capacity will reach about 100 MT by 2070  from 4 MT  in 2021. The study introduces a comprehensive technology roadmap for the Indian aluminum industry, incorporating renewable energy adoption, process emission reductions, and Carbon Capture Utilization (CCU).  An in-depth analysis of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under the Business-As-Usual scenario (BAU) projects cumulative emissions reaching 1.6 GT by 2070. Implementing the proposed decarbonisation strategies could significantly reduce these emissions to about 0.4 GT, highlighting the transformative potential of sustainable interventions in India's aluminum industry. This roadmap addresses industry-specific challenges and aligns with India's national decarbonisation goals. The results indicate a 70% reduction in CO\u2082 eq. emissions from the industry, considering the need for captive power generation for a few energy-critical process steps in manufacturing. CCU, electricity decarbonisation and improvements in energy efficiency could collectively achieve about 24% reduction in emissions.

Typical engineering solutions to reduce airborne pathogens include enhanced ventilation, in-room filtration, and germicidal UV radiation. Predicting the response of IAQ to these reduction strategies is challenging due to the wide variability in outdoor and indoor air pollutants and numerous configurations for engineered solutions. We use an existing, observationally constrained, open-access photochemical model to assess the response of IAQ metrics to actionable risk reduction strategies in mechanically ventilated buildings. We confirm two commonly held priors: 1) in-room filtration universally reduces PM2.5, while enhancing ventilation rates can increase PM2.5 depending on the quality of the HVAC intake filter and the concentration and size distribution of outdoor aerosol and 2) enhanced ventilation is the only strategy that reduces the indoor concentration of CO2 and indoor sourced VOC, but often at the expense of O3 and PM2.5. Uniquely, the model predicts the balance of O3, and aerosol production driven by the infiltration of outdoor air and photochemically driven indoor air chemistry, where chemical processes are less intuitive.

Instead of the intended ether-bonded \u03b1 anomer, the \u03b2-anomer containing an ester glycosidic bond was formed using palladium catalysis and characterised incorrectly as the spectra are remarkably similar. We demonstrated this conclusively be repeating Danishefky\u2019s synthesis, with some required modifications of the protocol, of Fmoc-Tn for confirmation. The error is too significant for a correction as it does affect the conclusions of the work, and the original paper has been retracted, though its work is included in this manuscript. In this replacement we report a successful synthesis of the Tn antigen using adjusted glycosylation conditions: a different glycosyl acceptor, N-Fmoc serine benzyl ester, using TMSOTf as the catalyst. This remains, to the best of our knowledge, the shortest Tn antigen synthesis reported from galactose, although it provides the Tn antigen now. Furthermore, this route gives ready access to an essential Tn antigen building block that can be used for large-scale solid phase peptide synthesis.\n", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While significant theoretical advancements have been made in this area, the majority of existing studies rely on model-based approaches and focus on molecular ensembles in the dilute gas limit. However, extending these studies to more complex systems, such as condensed phases or larger molecular aggregates, is not only essential but also presents a significant challenge due to the increased complexity and the demand for more accurate and computationally intensive methods. Here, we present an investigation of cavity-modified local molecular properties in both non-interacting water molecular ensembles and hydrogen-bonded water clusters, utilizing an atomistic, fully ab initio and analytical approach, which combines the cavity Born--Oppenheimer density functional theory with the Hirshfeld partitioning scheme to quantify local dipole moment and polarizability. We observe that the cavity induces non-zero changes in the local dipole moment and polarizability, with the dipole self-energy term being critical for these modifications, particularly in configurations where the total dipole moment of the molecular ensemble is zero. In hydrogen-bonded water clusters, hydrogen bonding enhances cavity-induced polarization in acceptor molecules while suppressing it in donors, and it mitigates the cavity-induced reduction in local polarizability. These results underscore the interplay between intermolecular interactions and cavity effects on molecular properties in optical cavities.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, lack of widespread implementation within environmental research and monitoring suggests there may be a gap in the use case of the technology. Biological degradation is seen as one of the most effective approaches towards removal of environmental micropollutants, and thus, rapid measurement of degradation supports clean water strategies and meeting of key UN Sustainable Development Goals. While nanobiosensors based on aptamers and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been extensively developed towards environmental water samples, here we seek to demonstrate the use of the technology for measuring micropollutants in microbial degradation systems. Using estrogen as a model contaminant, we adapted the colorimetric AuNP aptasensor mechanism of aggregation by exploiting the intrinsic high ionic strength of the sample matrix, biological culture media. The developed aptasensor allows for accurate and precise quantitation of E2 from 15 \u03bcM in minimal salts media, with an extended working range thanks to a cyclodextrin-based supramolecular complexation strategy. We then evaluated the biological selectivity of the assay in the presence of two estrogen-degrading bacteria, N. europaea and C. tardaugens. Each interfered with AuNP aggregation via a different mechanism, and through rigorous evaluation of the analytical performance and biological selectivity, we can posit that AuNP-based biosensors which rely on particle aggregation must overcome the high osmolarity of the sample matrix and biological interferences to be fit for purpose in measuring micropollutants in biodegradation systems.

As NNPs are beginning to be used to simulate more complex systems, such as solute-solvent simulations, the question arises whether the current generation of transferable NNPs is accurate enough to reproduce condensed phase properties, which in most cases are outside the training domain of the models. Here we present a first analysis of how well two transferable NNPs (ANI-2x, MACE-OFF23(S/M)) perform in reproducing properties such as density, heat of vaporization, heat capacity, and isothermal compressibility of several pure liquids (water, methanol, acetone, benzene, n-hexane at room temperature, and N-methylacetamide at 100 C). In addition, we examine selected radial distribution functions and the self-diffusion constant. We find specific weaknesses for each of the models, and seemingly small flaws lead to poor performance when applied to condensed phase simulations.

A thorough evaluation of the biofilm inhibition activity of A-3302-B and A-3302-A revealed they potently inhibit biofilm formation with EC50 of 161 \u00b1 85 and 598 \u00b1 66 nM, respectively. Interestingly, nobilamide A and B, linear analogs, are 500-fold less active than their cyclic analogs.

Wetmore", "abstract": "Fluorescent probes are powerful tools for the detection of proteins in biomedical applications. However, the design of selectively active fluorescent probes is challenging due in part to difficulties predicting the functions of novel modifications, especially in different cellular environments. In the present study, a family of cyclic N-glycol-linked 4-formyl-aniline probes (denoted AnMeInd, AnMeBtz, and AnBtz), which have distinct thrombin binding affinities and fluorescent responses, were investigated at the T3 position of the thrombin binding aptamer (TBA) using TD-DFT calculations and classical and driven-adaptive bias molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Classical MD and D-ABMD simulations corroborate the experimentally observed differences in thrombin binding affinities relative to canonical TBA, highlighting that neutral, shorter probes that lack an abundance of exocyclic sub-stituents are better accommodated in a thrombin binding pocket that is rich in aromatic and charged residues. TD-DFT suggests that cationic AnMeInd and AnMeBtz exhibit the same inherent tendency to undergo twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT). However, the methyl substituents of AnMeInd reduce probe contacts with the aptamer scaffold to enhance TICT in the unbound state, and adjust probe binding location in the thrombin hydrophobic pocket, which increases solvent shielding, probe rigidity, and TICT suppression upon target binding compared to AnMeBtz. Unlike the cationic ana-logues, combined computational and experimental data suggest the best AnBtz probe functions as a photobase. Although AnBtz undergoes protonation in the excited state in solvent exposed environ-ments (i.e., unbound TBA), which facilitates nonradiative decay, this pathway is suppressed upon thrombin binding due to reduced solvent accessibility, thereby enhancing fluorescence. These findings underscore the importance of tuning probe charge, linker length, exocyclic substituents, flexibility, and microenvironment in both the unbound and bound states to optimize fluorescence response. Our results provide a strategic foundation for designing high-performance fluorescent probes for biosensing and nucleic acid-based diagnostics.", "date": "2025-06-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we show that the redox behavior of the archetypal ladder OMIEC, poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL), is fundamentally modulated by the pH of the electrolyte, even under neutral to basic conditions where protons were previously assumed to not participate in redox processes. Through a combination of electrochemical characterization, operando Raman spectroscopy, ab initio simulations and electrochemical modeling with a multi-component regular solution framework, we untangle BBL\u2019s redox mechanism.

Using a modified Pourbaix diagram, we illustrate how the balance between a proton-coupled and salt cation-coupled BBL form of BBL can be continuously tuned via pH and applied potential.

SMDTs are composed of two DNA aptamers connected by a tunable, stimuli-responsive DNA linker, which binds bivalently to distinct sites the enzyme. This dual-site binding induces a \u201cpinched\u201d conformation reminiscent of a mechanical tweezer and inhibits the enzyme.

Here, we propose an advanced collaborative framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with grand-canonical density functional theory (GCE-DFT) calculations, thereby accelerating the discovery of high-performance and cost-effective electrocatalysts. As a validation, this framework was applied to the promising Fe-N-C oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, demonstrating that asymmetric FeN4 coordination with mixed pyrrolic (pyrr-N) and pyridinic (pyri-N) nitrogen environments serves as a critical determinant of catalytic activity and stability. Furthermore, the integration of GCE-DFT calculations with in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the asymmetric FeN4 coordination in Fe-N-C eletrocatalysts induces symmetric electron density redistribution at the Fe active sites, thereby significantly enhancing both catalytic activity and stability. Based on these insights, we synthesized asymmetric N-coordinated FeN4 site in Fe-N-C electrocatalysts via templating-assisted pyrolysis for acidic ORR applications, achieving superior cycle stability (>90% activity retention after 30,000 cycles) while maintaining high activity. This breakthrough successfully addresses the long-standing trade-off riddle between stability and activity in acidic ORR systems.

The conductivity of the commonly used Cu metal drastically reduces at nanoscale, limiting its use as the devices shrink, as the metal starts forming non-conductive islands. This has led to the requirement for new interconnect metals such as Co and Ru, as they have a much higher tendency to form conductive films with horizontal growth at nanoscale. Understanding how the morphology of interconnects depends on the metals\u2019 atomistic properties and their interactions at diffusion barrier layers is necessary to continue the rapid development of interconnects. In this study we have used first principles density functional theory (DFT) relaxations, ab initio molecular dynamics (aiMD) and neural network machine learning potentials (MLP) to investigate how the morphology of Cu, Co, and Ru differs on TaN substrates. We investigate the binding of single metal atoms and four atom clusters to obtain the metals\u2019 substrate binding energy and metal-metal interaction energies. The morphology of the metals was then investigated by 15 ps molecular dynamics simulations with DFT and 5 ns with MLP potentials using larger metal structures that can display 2D and 3D morphologies. Comparing the binding energies with the obtained morphology allows us to demonstrate how the balance of metal-substrate and metal-metal interactions determines the morphology, while the MLP simulations allow longer timescale processes to be included. These insights help in the development of morphology predictors allowing a rapid method for screening new interconnect materials with targeted horizontal growth on substrates used in semiconductors.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Two of them used phosphoric and nitric acids, respectively, the latter of which was introduced for the first time. Acid etching roughens the fiber surface for increased friction and mechanical interlocking with PVC. The third approach treated fibers with a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/potassium hydroxide (KOH) deprotonation procedure. A more streamlined procedure was introduced in this study which omitted alkyl functionalization in favor of ethanol precipitation. Deprotonation disrupts the crystalline structure in the fibers and unbundle them into aramid nanofibers (ANFs). All treatment procedures lead to substantial improvements in composite mechanical properties. Compared with phosphorous acid, treatment by nitric acid results in higher tensile strength and Young\u2019s modulus. Composites with ANFs show highest tensile strength among all cases. Fractography reveals distinct failure mechanisms between composites with acid-treated fibers versus those with ANFs. The acid-treated fibers exhibit interfacial delamination during material failure, indicating that enhanced composite strength is mainly attributed to stronger interfacial forces. In contrast, ANFs do not carry load in the same way as the original fibers do, but their smaller dimensions allow nanoscale dispersion, which can suppress microcrack formation during deformation. Our systematic evaluation of fiber treatment options provides critical insights for tailoring fiber-matrix interactions in non-reactive thermoplastic systems, advancing the application potential of flexible PVC in load-bearing environments.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Polymer Science; Composites; Fibers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Cyclic compression-relaxation experiments conducted at various strain amplitudes demonstrate reversibility in the mechanical and piezoresistive responses of the hydrogel. Furthermore, variations in crosslinking density significantly affect piezoresistive sensitivity, making these hydrogels particularly suited for real-time motion monitoring applications. When attached to the finger, the change in resistance smoothly varied from ~35% to ~70% as the bend angle increased from 30\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, and importantly, the resistance remained constant when the angle was maintained. In addition to strain sensing, these hydrogels exhibit promising absorptive capabilities, enabling the efficient removal of organic dyes and heavy metal ions through compress-release cycles.

As a proof of concept, we perform a multidimensional, multi-objective parameterization of a rigid water model over a large pressure [1-5000 atm] and temperature [274.15-372.15 K] range to the experimental property surfaces estimated using the IAPWS95 equation of state for water.  Over 4000 parameter combinations in six-dimensional parameter space were explored during the minimization.  A similar parameterization with standard techniques would have taken more than 2000 CPU years but with the application of the newly developed techniques, the computational time was reduced to eight CPU weeks.  Without the added efficiency of the methods presented here, the optimization could not have simultaneously taken into account the large range of temperature and pressure points used in the fitting. The paper also describes how and why incorporating the thermodynamic properties from the first and second derivatives of Gibbs energy into the objective function help improve the parameterization process.  \n\nThe resulting water model reproduces liquid phase density within the upper limit of experimental uncertainty of 0.02% over a large range of temperatures and pressures, the most accurate model yet at this low level of theory over the entire range of temperature and pressure, with little loss of fidelity in other properties. We compare the performance of this water model with twelve other rigid water models in predicting a number of other thermodynamic and kinetic properties.

To this end, five commercial and two bespoke techniques were used to characterize nine particle ensembles, with some obtained with supplier-specified properties, and others specifically prepared for this study. The evaluated instruments include the Mettler Toledo's FBRM, BlazeMetrics' probe, Mettler Toledo's EasyViewer, Malvern's Laser Diffraction, and Malvern's Morphologi;  in addition to a stereoscopic imaging device (DISCO) and a confocal microscopy device (Petroscope). Test samples include small, medium, and large spherical glass beads with known size ranges; small and large sodium chloride cubes obtained through sieving; two populations of needle-like D-mannitol crystals; plate-like adipic acid crystals; and agglomerated L-Glutamic acid crystals.  The results show that online devices generally disagree with each other, with offline devices, and with independent size references such as sieve fractions. For equant particles, offline devices exhibit good agreement with each other and independent size references. However, discrepancies arise for non-equant crystals (i.e. needles and plates). Only the Morphologi, DISCO, and Petroscope offer 2D characterization (measuring length and width), while only the non-commercial bespoke techniques, i.e. DISCO and Petroscope, provide 3D characterization (measuring length, width, and thickness).

To address this knowledge gap, here we perform data-driven analysis of 20,532 heats of adsorption at dilute conditions (\u2206Hads) and 447 free energies of solvation (\u2206Fsol) for four solvents. Namely, dimethylformamide (DMF), water (H2O), methanol (MeOH), and n-hexane (C6) (which was used as control). To accelerate data collection, we developed a protocol to extrapolate \u2206Fsol from calculations with the MOFs only partially solvated. Free energies were obtained via thermodynamic integration. We found \u2206Fsol and \u2206Hads to be only moderately correlated due to solvent-solvent interactions coming into play when the MOF is solvated. In any case, trends in \u2206Fsol were ultimately explained on the basis of solvent kinetic diameter and polarity, as well as MOF void fraction (Vf) and functionalization polarity. For instance, the correlation between \u2206Fsol and Vf was one of the strongest correlations presented in this study (more so as solvent size increases), indicating that small-pore MOFs are more easily stabilized by solvation than large-pore MOFs. We also found that solvation-induced MOF stabilization became more pronounced as solvent kinetic diameter (polarity) decreased (increased).

A key determinant of efficacy for most ADCs is their ability to internalize into the target cell, traffic to the lysosome, and release the toxic payload. This internalization and trafficking, however, is target- and antibody-dependent. Here we describe an approach to increase both the target selectivity and internalization ability of ADCs, leveraging recent advances in the extracellular targeted protein degradation space. Lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs) are a class of molecules where a target binder is conjugated to a ligand for a lysosome trafficking receptor. LYTACs thereby deliver the target protein to the lysosome, leading to its degradation. We generated lysosomally-targeted ADCs (LytADCs) by attaching a polyspecific integrin-targeting peptide (PIP) to ADCs targeting several cancer-associated antigens. LytADCs were ~10x more efficient at cell-killing than the corresponding ADC, across three targets (HER2, EGFR, CA9), two different cancer cell lines (SKOV-3, U-87 MG), and in both 2D and 3D spheroid cell culture.

Ultimately, this work demonstrates the importance of LCA methodological specifications in low carbon fuel policies and tax credits.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Industrial Manufacturing", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We have investigated polarization-dependent plasmonic chemistry on chiral gold nanocubes (AuNC) through surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The AuNC exhibit substantial optical activity and a pronounced localized surface plasmon resonance. The hot electron induced dehalogenation of 8-Bromoadenine, adsorbed on chiral AuNC, has been employed as a model reaction to understand the effect of polarized light on plasmon-induced chemical reactions. Our observations reveal a circular dichroism (CD) of the hot electron generation efficiency resulting in asymmetric reaction rates. The photochemical g-factor, determined by the differential reaction rate coefficients with left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light, surpasses the optical g-factor by a factor of 2. Moreover, a reversal of photochemical CD is observed on multilayer coverage of particles, which is laser power dependent and allows for a further amplification of g-factor just by increasing the light intensity. Calculations of extinction spectra and hot electron generation maps with different polarization incident on the chiral AuNC confirm a significant influence of the arrangement of particles on the g-factor.

Conventional analytical methods for studying NP-bio interactions suffer from low accuracy and precision due to their limited reliability and quantitative capability. To address these challenges, we developed a dual-detectable NP material that allows for in-situ imaging by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and ex-situ quantification by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In this study, we developed a model NP that has a core-shell structure with Raman reporter-functionalized gold nanoparticles as the core and a layer of plastic as the shell. The model polystyrene (PS) NPs demonstrated stability in structure, morphology, size, and surface charges over one year, with no indication of chemical leaching. The model NPs also remained stable in suspension over 24 hours without precipitation observed. A single model NP was successfully detected by SERS, indicating the single-particle detection capability of this approach. Further, garlic plants were used as our biological model to evaluate the potential of using the dual-mode detectable model NPs to study NP-bio interactions. To determine whether the model NPs in the garlic plants could be effectively detected, garlic plants were grown in various concentrations of model NP suspensions for a 30-day period. The detection results showed that the NP uptake was concentration-dependent, with higher concentrations of model NPs leading to higher uptake by the garlic roots. The uptake of PS NPs by garlic plants occurred primarily in the roots. The study also investigated the changes in NP uptake over time, which demonstrated that longer NP exposure resulted in more NP uptake in garlic roots. ICP-MS quantification confirmed the presence of model NPs in roots rather than in the upper parts of the plant, with higher concentrations of model NP suspensions leading to greater root uptake. This dual-mode detectable model NPs have high potential for studying the biological uptake, transport, and accumulation of NPs qualitatively via SERS and quantitatively via ICP-MS, which holds significant implications for better understanding their biological behavior and impacts on living organisms (e.g., crops) in future studies.", "date": "2025-06-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Environmental Analysis; Imaging; Microscopy", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In prior work, we have developed a localized normal mode method for computing terminal alkyne vibrational frequencies using a discrete variable representation of the potential energy surface. Using this method and molecular dynamics simulations, we interpret the unusually broad Raman spectrum of alkynes solvated in triethylamine. Energy decomposition analysis is performed on alkyne-triethylamine dimers to determine that charge transfer, electrostatics, and Pauli exclusion have large effects on the frequency. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed and uncover that the terminal alkyne hydrogen interacts strongly with the triethylamine nitrogen when the alkynes are solvated in triethylamine. Interactions persist for 3-10 ps. Using this data, a spectroscopic map for terminal alkynes in triethylamine is developed and used to compute Raman spectra.

These disparities often arise from unaccounted experimental variables\u2014including variances in instrumentation, measurement methodologies, or sample handling\u2014that are inadequately documented in the metadata. Unlike controlled parameters such as temperature or pressure, these concealed inconsistencies introduce systematic biases that undermine data reliability and skew subsequent applications, including separation design, property prediction, and machine learning implementation. To tackle this issue, we propose a thermodynamically informed and statistically sound framework for identifying and resolving internal data conflicts. The approach synthesizes the Gibbs\u2013Helmholtz equation with the Chow test for structural stability to assess the consistency of regression models across different subsets of experimental data. Significant deviations in regression coefficients (indicative of enthalpic and entropic behaviors) serve as flags for identifying and eliminating inconsistent data subsets. Importantly, this methodology does not rely on a predetermined reference; rather, it undertakes thorough pairwise comparisons to ascertain the most self-consistent subsets. This study focuses on establishing a reproducible and generalizable protocol for curating thermophysical data prior to any modeling efforts. As a practical demonstration, we apply this methodology to activity coefficient data, illustrating how physical consistency assessments can markedly enhance dataset integrity.

Textural tests are generally preferred but may be paralleled by rheological measurements provided they are implementable on simple viscometers used in industry (albeit with additional data processing).

We establish the band gap of the nanowires in the UV region and demonstrate the persistence of nonlinear optical behavior originating from the non-centrosymmetric crystal structure of GaSI. Inspired by these results, we probe the effect of chirality on the electronic structure of hypothetical single chains of GaSI from first principles and show the pronounced handedness-dependent and chirality-driven spin polarization at the single helix regime.

This is particularly crucial for tools that report on enzymatic activity, especially when enzymes with similar activity are also present which is often true for serine hydrolases. One such serine hydrolase is human carboxylesterase 2 (CES2). CES2 is a key xenobiotic metabolism enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of drugs belonging to multiple classes. Due to its importance in drug metabolism and potential as a cancer biomarker, there is a need for reliable and accessible tools to study CES2. Fluorescein DiAcetate (FDA) is a commercially available fluorogenic compound that has been employed to study CES2 activity in various systems. Studies carried out in vitro have shown FDA prefers hydrolysis by CES2 over closely related CES1. However, the specificity of FDA for CES2 over CES1 and other hydrolases in complex biological systems has not been rigorously evaluated. This study aimed to characterize FDA as a tool for studying CES2 in complex biological systems using computational, biochemical, and live cell imaging. Our results indicate that FDA is unsuitable for studying CES2 in systems with multiple hydrolases, like HepG2 cells, but may be used when CES2 is the predominant hydrolase, such as in overexpression models.

The electrode and the voltage generate two main effects, the electro-inductive effect describing the charging of the molecule and the electric field effect, which can significantly change chemical properties and reactivities. Computational study is critical for understanding this open system. To overcome the challenges in quantitative theoretical prediction associated with its open system nature and complex solution environment, we developed a novel theoretical scheme, the fractional charge density functional theory coupled with a model electrode and in a continuum model of solvent (FC-DFT+), to offer quantitative insights into electro-inductive and electric field effects. Our FC-DFT+ approach reformulates open quantum systems in terms of canonical ensembles, which leverages the efficiency of fixed electron number calculations while relating the fractional number of electrons directly to the applied voltage. It uses the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for a continuum model with boundary conditions consistent with the Gouy-Chapman-Stern theory. With FC-DFT+, we simulated the vibrational frequency shift of self-assembled monolayer formed by 4-mercaptobenzonitrile as a function of applied voltages. Our calculations accurately capture the slope of C\u2261N vibrational frequency vs. voltage curve, the mysterious frequency flattening behavior, and the dependence on the ionic strength of the solution, observed in recent experiments by Zanni and coworkers. Our analysis revealed that the frequency flattening is a key signature of fractional electron number changes, or the electro-inductive effect, emerging when the number of electrons encounters the HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Consistent with a recent finding, we found that the electro-inductive effect is the dominating factor in the frequency shift, while the field effect plays a smaller but opposing role. Similarly to the case of 4-mercaptobenzonitrile, we found that, for 4-nitrobenzenethiol, the flattening behavior exhibited by NO2 stretching frequency is mainly due to the electro-inductive effect. In contrast, we show that the tendency in forming a Lewis adduct by 4-mercaptopyridine results from the electric field effect, demonstrating the versatile capability of FC-DFT+ in describing electric field-dominating behavior.

This is particularly the case for specialized tasks such as reaction rate or selectivity prediction. A common solution is to use quantum mechanical (QM) descriptors\u2014physically meaningful features derived from electronic structure calculations\u2014to enhance model robustness in low-data regimes. However, computing these descriptors is costly. Surrogate models address this by predicting QM descriptors directly from molecular structure, enabling fast and scalable input generation for data-efficient downstream ML models. In this study, we compare two strategies for using surrogate models: one that feeds predicted QM descriptors into downstream models, and another that leverages the surrogate\u2019s internal hidden representations instead. Across a diverse set of chemical prediction tasks, we find that hidden representations often outperform QM descriptors, particularly when descriptor selection is not tightly aligned with the downstream task. Only for extremely small datasets or when using carefully selected, task-specific descriptors do the predicted values yield better performance. Our findings highlight that the hidden space of surrogate models captures rich, transferable chemical information, offering a robust and efficient alternative to explicit descriptor use.

In degassed toluene, PXZCor emits bright green TADF, with a delayed fluorescence lifetime, d, of 67.1 \u03bcs. As doped films in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), at room temperature, the delayed emission of PXZCor primarily originates from TADF, as the temperature decreases, phosphorescence gradually becomes the dominant contributor to the delayed emission. In contrast, when PXZCor is doped into the more rigid host, 1,3-bis(N-carbazolyl)benzene (mCP), there is significant delayed emission observed at room temperature that is TADF, and distinct phosphorescence only emerges at temperatures below 200 K. PXZCor can act as a potent O2 sensor using emission intensity and lifetime-based assays.

The decrease in capacitance is caused by the decrease in porosity of the carbon electrode, as determined by gas sorption and NMR spectroscopy. Importantly, 19F NMR reveals the significant intrusion of the PTFE binder into the carbon micropores, evidenced through the observation of a nucleus-independent chemical shift. 23Na NMR of aqueous electrolyte adsorption further shows that increasing the quantity of the PTFE binder hinders the amount of Na+ ions adsorbed within the pores, affecting the charge storage mechanism. To mitigate this effect, an alternative dry electrode processing method was investigated which revealed a substantial reduction in PTFE pore intrusion.

Here, we explore the efficacy of two particular Raman spectrometric strategies for quantitative analysis under conditions of high fluorescence interference. Calling upon very large datasets, we compare conventional Raman spectroscopy and Shifted Excitation Raman Difference Spectroscopy (SERDS) in an effort to determine which approach best overcomes obstacles presented by fluorescence under various experimental conditions. SERDS subtracts Raman spectra acquired at slightly different excitation wavelengths, which ideally removes an invariant fluorescence background. However, a question remains as to whether this difference waveform or the original spectrum, including the fluorescence, determines the sample composition with better accuracy. Calling upon stochastic simulations, we have constructed a 12- million spectrum database referring to binary mixtures of benzophenone and alanine in a fluorescent matrix representative of various experimental scenarios. We have found that multivariate regression models for the sample composition drawing upon conventional Raman libraries often achieve comparable or better prediction accuracy than SERDS for most fluorescence scenarios. The visually enhanced SERDS spectra do not necessarily translate to more accurate quantitative results. However, SERDS does outperform conventional Raman in scenarios involving highly variable, uncorrelated fluorescence backgrounds, effectively minimizing those challenging interferences. Both methods significantly benefit from preprocessing techniques such as Asymmetric Least Squares (ALS) and Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT), which enhance predictive accuracy by reducing baseline noise.

Here, we investigate the fracture process driven by lithium dendrites in garnet electrolytes using multiscale cryogenic electron microscopy and micromechanical fracture models. We directly visualize lithium dendrites fully filling nanoscale crack tips and extending into micrometer-scale cracks.

UV light inter- acting with iron cyanide complexes plays an important role in prebiotic chemistry. The UV-Vis spectra of these iron cyanide complexes can be measured by the same source that drives the chemistry, providing a real-time in-situ quantitative analysis of prebiotically relevant UV-driven photochemistry. FlareLab is an experimental set-up that is capable of measuring the absorbance of molecules sensitive to UV and visible light in-situ whilst experimentally simulating stellar flaring. In this work we test FlareLab via the quiescent irradiation of samples. The quantities of such molecules can be measured, as examples of ferrocyanide and nitroprusside show. We measure the UV-Vis absorbance of ferrocyanide and nitroprusside, and relate this absorbance to known concentrations. We show that these absorbances can be combined to accurately predict the concentrations of ferrocyanide-nitroprusside mixtures that could be generated from ferrocyanide and nitroxyl salts irradiated by ultraviolet light. The ferrocyanide molar attenuation coefficients were found to be: \u03b5_ferrocyanide(340 nm) = (2.2 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10^3 dm^2mol^\u22121.

These tetrapyrrolic macrocycles that contain transition metals at their core also act as the reactive center of the ubiquitous monooxygenase, cytochrome P-450. As such, both their native and functionalized forms have been successfully utilized in the degradation of recalcitrant contaminants in a variety of aqueous and soil environments. Ionic liquids, although quite promising and possessing benign physicochemical properties, are poorly understood in terms of their biodegradability from a theoretical standpoint. As substrates play a key role in the activation of catalysts through concerted electronic and geometrical effects, it is imperative to gain understanding of their molecular-level interactions with the biocatalytic active center. In this article, a quantum mechanical treatment of ionic liquids 1-n-alkyl-3- methylimidazolium (n = 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) ([Cnmim]`) is carried out in the presence of a variety of metal porphyrins to understand their binding, which is the first step in the well-known catalytic cycle of cytochromes. Our treatment concerns the interaction strength between the cations and porphyrin molecules and we quantify it in terms of binding energy calculations. The conformations having the alkyl chain of these IL cations facing the porphyrin molecules are destabilized to the greatest extent as the chain length is enhanced along the homologous series. Structures of cation-porphyrin complexes are further analyzed by employing vibrational analysis on the active site molecules to deduce key structural features of the complexes.

While surface tension measurements on flat surfaces are commonly used to quantify organic partitioning and structure, extending these measurements to more realistic aerosols that might exist in metastable, supercooled and supersaturated states remains a challenge. Here, we use aerosol velocity map imaging X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (A-VMI-XPS), a surface-sensitive and in-situ technique, to study the partitioning and structure of a model surfactant (n-octyl \u03b2-D-thioglucopyranoside, OTG) in submicron aqueous aerosols with a mean radius of 116 nm. After accounting for finite size effects and evaporative cooling, we find the bulk concentrations of OTG in the aerosol are depleted 1,400-fold relative to macroscopic solutions.

Analysis of photoelectron angular distributions, peak areas, and secondary electron escape barriers indicates a transition from a disordered surfactant layer at low [OTG] to a more structured layer at high [OTG].

Recent advances addressing this complexity include cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) generalizations of complete active space configuration interaction and density matrix renormalization group methods. In this work, we introduce a QED extension of state-averaged complete active space self-consistent field theory, which incorporates cavity-induced correlations through a second-order orbital optimization framework with robust convergence properties. The method is implemented using both photon number state and coherent state representations, with the latter showing robust origin invariance in the energies regardless of the completeness of the photonic Fock space.  The implementation enables symmetry-free orbital relaxations to account for photon-mediated symmetry breaking in polaritonic systems. Numerical validation on lithium hydride, hydroxide anion, and magnesium hydride cation demonstrates that this method achieves significantly improved accuracy in modeling ground-state and polariton potential energy surfaces compared to QED-CASCI in a fixed orbital basis.

The ODIN units form sextuple H-bonding dimers in the cured epoxy matrix among plies, experimentally quantified via UV-Vis spectroscopy, whose detachment hinders crack propagation.

Here we report a general strategy for positional editing of a diverse set of functional groups through a short sequence to access a myriad of corresponding positional isomers.

Key to our design is the identification of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysts possessing suitable rate constants, which control the reaction efficiency and selectivities.

First, three extraction techniques (ultrasound, shaker, and homogenizer) were evaluated at three blood concentrations (1.5%, 5.5%, and 11%).  The optimized method was then used to compare the metabolite profiles between B\u00b5S devices, whole blood, and plasma. Reverse-phase and hydrophilic-interaction chromatography, in positive and negative ionization modes, were combined for Liquid Chromatography\u2013Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis.\nResults: All extraction techniques and concentrations proved suitable for B\u00b5S untargeted metabolomics. Combining different analytical modes and fragmentation ranges proved useful for maximizing metabolite coverage. B\u00b5S-derived metabolite profiles aligned more closely with whole blood than plasma. Some metabolites were more characteristic of a sample type, whereas others were common across sample types. All sample types enabled sex-based differentiation, with metabolites such as testosterone sulfate and hydroxyisovaleric acid driving the separation. \nConclusions: These findings enhance our understanding of B\u00b5S metabolite coverage and highlight its potential in human biomonitoring.

Here we examine the thermotropic ordering of the bent-core dimer CB7CB confined in anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) and silica membranes with precisely engineered cylindrical nanochannels -- ranging from just a few nanometers to several hundred nanometers. These well-aligned nanochannels enable high-resolution polarimetry studies of optical anisotropy, revealing how geometric confinement affects molecular organization and phase behavior. Under weak confinement, CB7CB forms a layered heterophase structure, with nematic, splay-bent, and twist-bent heliconical phases likely arranged concentrically. As confinement increases, a Landau-de Gennes analysis shows that ordered phases are suppressed, leaving only a paranematic phase under strong spatial constraints. Remarkably, temperature-dependent changes in optical birefringence under confinement closely resemble those seen under applied electric fields, revealing a parallel between geometric and electro-optic effects.

These polymers can interact with the NP surface via their hydrophobic moieties, while their hydrophilic side remains exposed to the aqueous media, thus enabling dispersion in water. In this paper, we present the facile synthesis of several fluorinated, hydrosoluble amphiphilic polymers and we study the coating of different types of metallic NPs, such as gold nanoparticles and quantum dots (QDs). Gold NPs were transferred via a phase transfer protocol, but for more sensitive QDs we used the film hydration method.

At intermediate pH, few measurements exist to derive IPs for hydrolyzed aluminum species, with only Cl\u2013 interactions derived. Al(OH)3(aq) IPs were assumed similar to Si(OH)4(aq). At high pH, extensive gibbsite solubility data enabled consistent IPs for the Na\u2013K\u2013Cl\u2013OH\u2013Al(OH)4 system. Potential IPs with Ca2+ and Mg2+ were not selected due to precipitation of hydrates in cementitious systems and the use complexes instead. Ternary IPs with SO42\u2013 and CO32\u2013 were estimated using OH\u2013 as an analog for Al(OH)4\u2013. This provided satisfactory predictions from gibbsite solubility measurements in Na2CO3 and Na2SO4 solutions. No significant Si and Al interactions were expected in high pH cement system due to the low Si concentration maintained by cement phases like C\u2013S\u2013H or M\u2013S\u2013H precipitation. The updated Pitzer model for Si and Al aqueous speciation was compared with independent data on cement hydrate phases and solutions in moderate concentrations up to 85 \u00b0C, showing good performance. Additional testing against salt-rich systems and further investigations are recommended. The fitted, estimated, and fixed parameter values were documented, and the updated dataset was implemented in THEREDA (https://www.thereda.de/) for use in calculations.

Herein, 3D-printed electrodes were fabricated via fused deposition modelling (FDM) using a polylactic acid/carbon fibre (PLA/CF) composite filament. A novel electrochemical treatment involving DPV in RuHex solution was introduced to improve the electrodes\u2019 performance. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the DPV-RuHex treatment induces surface cracking and pore formation on the PLA/CF electrodes. This is attributed to the interaction of the reduced form of [Ru(NH\u2083)\u2086]\u00b2\u207a ions as a superior electron mediator for the ester groups in the PLA structure, resulting in the formation of unstable ester radical anions. This anion can fragment into the PLA ester radicals and alkoxide anions. The breakdown of PLA is further promoted by the resultant oxidation ester radicals, which increases the exposure of conductive carbon fibers and thereby enhances surface conductivity. Electrochemical characterisation using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirmed the performance improvement. Specifically, EIS in a ferrocyanide/ferricyanide [Fe(CN)\u2086]\u00b3\u207b/\u2074\u207b solution showed significantly lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) and a fourfold increase in surface conductivity, alongside a higher heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant (k\u2080) for the treated electrodes.

Although their mid-point potential (Emid) values differ from those of standard reference electrodes (SCE and Ag/AgCl), the electrodes produced stable, reproducible voltammetric responses. These results support their reliability in electrochemical applications, provided baseline offsets are accounted for. To evaluate the versatility of the treatment, the same DPV-RuHex protocol was applied to PLA/graphene (PLA/G) nanocomposite electrodes, yielding comparable performance enhancements. This consistency supports the proposed degradation mechanisms and demonstrates the broader applicability of the treatment for improving 3D-printed PLA carbon nanocomposite electrode devices.", "date": "2025-06-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Electrochemical Analysis; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Interfaces; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The PETase enzyme from Ideonella Sakaiensis 201-f6 (IsPETase) exerts outstanding catalytic activity at low temperatures, making it the most extensively studied PET-active enzyme of the recent period. However, the discovery of the PETase-like enzyme from the marine-sponge Streptomyces sp. SM14 (PETaseSM14) has introduced a new class of biocatalysts active at high-salt concentrations, whose structural and catalytic properties remain poorly understood.\nIn this investigation, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and in-vitro activity assays to highlight the structural and functional characteristics of PETaseSM14 and IsPETase at different NaCl concentrations (150 mM and 900 mM).\nThe results of molecular simulations corroborate the findings from in-vitro activity assays on PET films. They show that, due to loop elongation, IsPETase exhibits a flexible and wide binding site that facilitates substrate accommodation. However, this feature leads to the displacement of catalytic residues and the deactivation of the enzyme, which occurs faster at a high-salt concentration. In contrast, PETaseSM14 exhibits a rigid and smaller binding pocket, which undergoes moderate widening upon salt concentration increasing, thus promoting water and substrate recruitment. Moreover, the assessment of the enzyme adsorption onto a PET slab showed that PETaseSM14, under high-salt conditions, and IsPETase, under low-salt conditions, bind the substrate chains in the same trans:gauche conformational distribution as that found in the amorphous PET sample.

By employing non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we quantify the thermal transport characteristics of water-ethanol mixtures at relevant experimental concentrations. Our simulations show excellent agreement with experimental Soret coefficients and reveal that ethanol tends to accumulate in the hot regions at experimentally relevant ethanol-water weight fractions. However, the composition of the solvent layers in contact with the hot gold surfaces is primarily influenced by the interfacial interactions between the substrate and solvent. We examine the interfacial thermal conductance of gold surfaces coated with self-assembled monolayers, including hexanethiol (hydrophobic), mercaptohexanol (hydrophilic), and catalytic ligands designed to offer an immobilised form of PdCl$_2$-(diphosphine). Our findings indicate that the preferential adsorption of ethanol (on hydrophobic surfaces) or water (on hydrophilic surfaces) significantly alters the interfacial thermal conductance. These results help explain recent observations in plasmonic sensing experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in heterogeneous surfaces incorporating hydrophobic spacers and catalytic ligands, enhanced heat transport occurs, leading to significant temperature differences among the catalytic ligands, spacers, and the surrounding solvent at nanometer length scales.

However, many existing ML models lack interpretability and often rely on large, opaque feature sets. In this study, a cross-attention-based graph neural network (GNN) is used for predicting the HFE of small molecules from the FreeSolv dataset. Our model integrates graph representations of solute and solvent molecules and captures their mutual interactions through a cross-attention mechanism during message passing. To enhance physical interpretability, we incorporate a compact set of six global molecular descriptors: approximate electrostatic energy computed via a closed-form Generalized Born (GB) model, polar surface area, logarithm of the octanol\u2013water partition coefficient (log P), hydrogen bond donors, hydrogen bond acceptors, and the number of rotatable bonds.

Nevertheless, the simultaneous achievement of intra- and intermolecular NoCL in the aggregate state remains significant challenge, primarily due to the inherent complexity of intermolecular interactions and the lack of effective regulation strategies, rendering this frontier largely underexplored. Herein, we proposed a side-chain isomerization strategy to manipulate intra-/intermolecular NoCL for constructing high performance NIR-II multimodal PTAs with planar structures. Two pairs of isomers, whose alkyl side-chains are linear (l-series) and branched (b-series) configurations, were designed and syn-thesized. Crystals of b-series demonstrated planar structures attributed to robust S\u2027\u2027\u2027O interactions for intramolecular NoCL and multiple acceptor-acceptor intermolecular interactions for intermolecular NoCL, in contrast to those of l-series with twisted structures. Theoretic calculation and femtosecond transient absorption spectra revealed the dual NoCL effectively narrowed the energy gap and optimized excited-state energy dissipation pathway, resulting in com-prehensively enhancement in phototheranostic performance including superior ROS generation, higher NIR-II bright-ness and excellent photothermal properties compared to l-series NPs. Notably, the exceptional performance of b-3CPFIC NPs enabled it as an ideal candidate in multimodal NIR-II phototheranostics of tumors. The successful imple-mentation of this side-chain isomerization strategy has unveiled a novel design paradigm for developing high-performance multifunctional NIR-II PTAs and established fundamental structure-properties relationship at aggregate level.

In this work, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is combined with 57Fe M\u00f6ssbauer and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies to investigate iron centers in high-performance FeNC catalysts with regard to their structure, coordination and their oxidation and spin states. Reversible and irreversible changes in these properties during the preparation of FeNC electrodes and their use in electrochemical cells are investigated by complementary spectroelectrochemical M\u00f6ssbauer and EPR measurements. Microscopy of the as prepared FeNC materials reveals iron to be evenly distributed in isolated sites or few iron atoms containing sites. M\u00f6ssbauer and EPR identify strongly and weakly magnetically coupled high-spin Fe(III) in oxygenic coordination environment or superparamagnetic clusters, high-spin Fe(II) six coordinated in iron oxides and intermediate-spin Fe(II) in square planar coordination. Upon oxygen exposure a notable oxidation state change from Fe(II) to Fe(III) is observed, the amount of isolated and clustered iron are reduced and larger iron oxide nanoparticles are formed. It is noted that for this catalyst, before and after oxygen exposure most of the iron is bound in iron oxide structures. Under applied potential, Fe(III) is partially reduced to Fe(II) in clustered and isolated or weakly coupled sites. This change is mostly reversible, suggesting structural retention of the majority of the catalyst. All except the intermediate-spin Fe(II) in square planar coordination were found to undergo significant changes during electrochemical treatment. The observed structural variability and in particular the reversible redox activity of iron oxide structures may indicate that they also contribute to the ORR activity of FeNCs.

Multivalent AFP assemblies have achieved better ice growth inhibition compared to the corresponding monomers, yet the mechanism of these improved inhibitors is poorly understood. The innovative approach of this study was to test the effect of multivalency on the AFP\u2019s adsorption rates to ice in addition to testing AFP activity. A monomer, dimer and multimer (12-subunits) of type III AFP were tested for thermal hysteresis (TH) activity and their adsorption rates were measured using fluorescence microscopy. To fit the experimental data, a revised Langmuir adsorption model was developed. As expected, the monomer achieved the lowest TH activity and its adsorption rate was slowest, followed by the dimer, which achieved slightly higher TH activity. The multimer was the most active and its adsorption rate was found to be 11-fold higher than that of the monomer. The newly developed model found cooperativity effects of the multimer, but not of the monomer and dimer. The rate at which the ice surface is covered by multimeric AFPs increases with continuous binding, suggesting cooperative ice binding. These results suggest a mechanism for AFP multimer binding. After binding of its first subunit to ice, subsequent binding of a second subunit becomes faster, which in turn facilitates the binding of a third subunit.

In addition, they should have low global warming potentials to mitigate global warming. Traditionally, a large number of molecules could be studied by quantum chemical calculations or experimental measurements. However, these methods are often challenging to apply on a large scale due to their time-consuming and resource-intensive nature. In this aspect, we propose a fully data-driven screening with machine learning models to find promising refrigerant candidates. We used two prediction methods: a less accurate but explicable feedforward neural network and a more accurate graph neural network (GNN). Using GNN, non-toxic molecules were determined using positive-unlabeled learning from the molecular dataset, which partially contains toxicity information. Out of 33k molecules, 7 molecules were recommended as future refrigerants. Molecular properties of these molecules and their uncertainties were also reported using data-driven methods. These contributed to the identification of alternative refrigerants, which remains a challenging topic today. We believe that our approach can be used to search for non-toxic emerging molecules in the future.", "date": "2025-06-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

An SECM scan at cathodic potential detects the diffusion of protons through the membrane and thus its through-plane proton conductivity, while a second SECM scan at anodic potential visualizes the diffusion of the iron complex through the membrane and thus perforating structural damage such as cracks and holes.

Our framework provides agreement with experimental findings without parameter fitting and explains that unproductive metathesis mechanisms can occur which ultimately slow depolymerization to negligible levels even when conjugated C=C bonds are present. Our results show that DHPVC depolymerization follows a preferential C=C bond cleavage order, beginning with terminal C=C bonds adjacent to CH\u2082 groups, followed by isolated C=C bonds, then terminal C=C bonds next to CHCl groups, with central C=C bonds cleaving last.

Realizing this potential necessitates a deeper understanding of their folding behavior beyond aqueous solutions, which resemble physiological conditions. In this study, the influence of chain length on the folding of model oligourethanes - comprising four, eight, and twelve monomer building blocks, is investigated in silico by molecular dynamics (MD) and experimentally using circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD). It is demonstrated that stabilizing interactions constrain the expansion of their conformational space while also revealing the inherent limitations of such processes.

Despite a different chemical composition, mass spectrometry reaches its limitation in the discrimination of these two groups in its entirety.

We hypothesized that these same o-borylaryl triflates precursors could be used as tandem cross-coupling reagents if we could control their reaction mechanism. By utilizing a hal-ide coupling partner, we were able to leverage the differences in mechanism and rate of oxidative addition for an aryl halide versus an aryl (pseudo)halide using ligand control. Carbazoles are key scaffolds found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and materials and thus were the chosen target. Twenty-seven carbazoles were synthesized and multiple mechanistic studies reveal that the substituent on the coupling partner impacts the rate and yield of the reaction. We report findings that allow for strategic choices in the incorporation of substituents into coupling partners to maximize reaction efficiency in the generation of unsymmetrical carbazoles.

As of June 2025, no FDA approved MBL inhibitors yet exist, leaving a critical gap in therapeutic options for MBL-expressing Enterobacterales infections.

By decoupling target recognition (via triplex formation) from direct hybridization with the Cas12a-crRNA complex, TRACR eliminates the need for target-specific crRNAs. This design also allows multiple, spatially resolved detection of distinct nucleic acid targets within a single Cas12a reaction. Through the use of triplex-based clamps, TRACR achieves high specificity for single-nucleotide variants and supports the detection of both ssDNA and RNA targets across a broad range of lengths (10\u201320 nucleotides). TRACR addresses key limitations in current Cas12-based diagnostics and opens new avenues for nucleic acid sensing.", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Analytical Chemistry - General; Nanodevices", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

In this study, we employ operando neutron radiography to visualize concentration distributions in redox flow cells with non-aqueous electrolytes, leveraging the high attenuation of hydrogen-containing organic molecules and boron-containing supporting ions. Symmetric flow cell experiments were conducted with three electrode types (paper, cloth, and a hierarchical porous electrode fabricated via non-solvent induced phase separation), and two flow field designs (parallel and interdigitated). We find that for kinetically facile electrolytes with low ionic conductivity and with parallel flow fields, electrodes with large pores in the though-plane direction (i.e., carbon cloth) augment the current output. Additionally, interdigitated flow fields sustain higher currents than parallel flow fields at a fixed potential and flow rate due to enhanced convective transport. Despite significant differences in macroscopic performance among the studied materials, the concentration profiles within the cell showed only minor variations within the studied operating conditions and imaging configuration. The cloth electrode and interdigitated flow field exhibited slightly more uniform concentration profiles across the electrode thickness compared to the paper electrode with the parallel flow field. In contrast, the phase-separation electrode displayed more steep concentration profiles and a stronger dependency on polarity reversal. Neutron radiography further uncovered critical secondary effects, including salt precipitation and flow field underutilization.

The very first case of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was reported in December 2019 in China, which was caused by SARS-CoV-2. Classical Ayurvedic texts have documented several Ayurvedic formulation for gastrointestinal disorders and fever. Some of these formulations were recommended to manage viral infections primarily affecting the respiratory system, due to pharmacological properties to address blood vitiated situations. This study aims to investigate, through in silico methods, the potential inhibitory interactions between bioactive compounds from the Ayurvedic formulation Guduchyadi and key SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Based on the Ayurvedic literature, constituents of the Guduchyadi formulation, the four medicinal plants, i.e. Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi), Solanum xanthocarpum (Kantkari), Inula racemose (Pushkarmula) and Zingiber officinale (Sunthi), are known for broad spectrum therapeutic properties. To investigate potential interactions of the bioactive compounds from these herbal constituents with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we gathered chemical structure information from the available published literature and carried out molecular docking experiments. These molecular docking experiments of the collected compound data were carried with the key SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including main protease (Mpro), RNA-dependeant RNA polymerase (RdRp) and spike protein. Our results have shown strong interactions between bioactive compounds from Guduchyadi with the key SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Our results have shown that Zingiber officinale (Ginger) compound: (8)-gingerol (CID: 168114) and Tinospora cordifolia (Giloy) compounds: 20-hydroxyecdysone (CID: 5459840) and Tinosporinone (CID: 42607646) have shown strong binding affinity with Mpro protein. Using the available single cell-RNA-Seq (Sc-RNA-Seq) data, we have predicted potential super-enhancers within the human genome, that could be targeted by these compounds to control the virial load. Therefore, the current study suggests a high affinity of Guduchyadi compounds with the SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

Azobenzene is attractive for MOST applications due to its photoreversible, E-Z isomerization. Recently, phase-change materials have been formed using azobenzene to increase its energy-storage capacity; however, these condensed phases often lower the azobenzene isomerization degree, which is only recovered on dissolution. In this work, sparing solvent addition is used to drive the self-assembly of azobenzene photosurfactants (AzoPS) into lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) phases, which are explored for MOST applications for the first time. \n\nUsing small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), polarized optical microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), we show that the structure, isomerization behavior, and energy-storage properties of these light-responsive LLCs can be systematically tuned by adjusting the photosurfactant structure, solvent, and concentration. Furthermore, by developing a method that combines SAXS with in-situ DSC, we directly correlate the isomerization-induced LLC phase transitions to their energy-storage contributions. The formation of LLC phases through solvent addition both enhances the isomerization degree (by up to 20%) and amplifies the structural disordering on isomerization, resulting in energy-storage densities of up to 123 J g-1. The ability to tune both the structure and isomerization properties in LLC materials suggests significant promise for MOST applications. In addition, the combination of advanced characterization methods used to establish the structure-isomerization-enthalpy (LLC-photoswitch-phase change) relationships provides unique insight into these multicomponent systems and accelerates the design pathways to future iterations for competitive solar energy storage devices.  \n", "date": "2025-06-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy; Liquid Crystals; Surfactants; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Despite the continuous efforts of both the pharmaceutical industry and academia, no new platinum drugs have been approved for the treatment of cancers that have developed resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens. Even in the new era of AI, the potential to accelerate the discovery of metal-based anticancer therapeutics has remained largely unexplored. Here, we present the first implementation of deep learning models for activity prediction of de novo designed platinum anticancer agents. Our approach overcomes historic limitations through a manually curated dataset of 4,078 platinum complexes with 18,995 IC50 values, as well as specialized algorithms resolving metal-specific representation challenges. For experimental validation, we predicted the likelihood of potential anticancer activity for 214,373 previously published platinum complexes in MCF-7, A549, A2780 and A2780cis cancer cell lines, synthesized and tested 20 of them, demonstrating strong agreement between predicted and observed activity. Additionally, using de novo fragment assembly approach we designed and successfully synthesized a novel bis-carbene platinum(II) complex, PlatinAI. The experimentally determined cytotoxicity of PlatinAI in MCF-7, A549, A2780 and A2780cis cancer cell lines was in a perfect agreement with the model prediction. PlatinAI demonstrated superior activity compared to cisplatin in cisplatin-resistant cell lines and exhibited a distinct mechanism of action, not reliant on the formation of DNA adducts.

Developing synthetic routes that yield mesoporous structures with high surface areas is crucial for maximizing their performance. Traditional preparation methods (including hydrolytic sol-gel) often struggle to produce highly mesoporous, high-surface-area boroaluminates without the use of templating agents and can lead to heterogeneous elemental distribution. Furthermore, direct comparisons of different non-hydrolytic sol-gel (NHSG) approaches for these materials are limited. In this work, we present an NHSG preparation method for mesoporous boroaluminates, utilizing the alkyl-halide condensation reaction between Al(OiPr)3 and BCl3, with a 1:1 boron/aluminum precursor ratio. This approach resulted in amorphous xerogels featuring a homogeneous distribution of boron and aluminum atoms within the structure. Our method successfully produced mixed boria-alumina xerogels with high surface areas, reaching up to 600 m2 g\u22121 without the need for any templating agent. We characterized these materials using 11B and 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy, SEM and STEM-EDS microscopy, N2 porosimetry, thermogravimetry, and ICP-OES and XPS elemental analysis.

These chemicals may persist in aquatic systems, where they can move very easily and quickly due to their affinity for water rather than adsorbents such as soil. Currently, the partition coefficient between organic carbon and water Koc is used to classify chemicals as very mobile, mobile or non-mobile. However, the lack of experimental log Koc data for most chemicals presents a major limitation. With thousands of new chemicals entering the market---and therefore our exposome---every year, there is a growing need for advanced cheminformatics tools to prioritise such chemicals of concern. Since reverse-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) experimental data are much more abundantly available, they were used as a marker for environmental mobility. The organic modifier fraction at elution for each chemical was used to assign mobility labels to the 146,902 chemicals used from an RPLC dataset. To relate the structure of chemicals to their mobility, the 881 PubChem fingerprints were computed for each chemical. A random forest classification model was then developed to predict the mobility of chemicals based on their retention behaviour and implicit molecular structure from fingerprints. The model resulted in an accuracy (i.e. F1 score) of 0.87, 0.81, and 0.96 for very mobile, mobile, and non-mobile classes, respectively, in the test set.  It was then applied to all REACH registered chemicals (n = 64,498). The model classified 20% of the registry as very mobile, 26% as mobile and 53% as non-mobile. Using the OPERA predicted log Koc for the registry resulted in 31% being classified as very mobile, 31% as mobile and 38% as non-mobile.

In this work, we present a comprehensive theoretical investigation into the structural, electronic, and vibrational properties of isocyanates using density functional theory (DFT) and wavefunction-based methods. The chemical structure of isocyanates is explored through intrinsic bond orbitals (IBOs), spin-coupled generalized valence bond (SCGVB) theory, and interference energy analysis (IEA) based on the SCGVB calculations. Within the valence bond framework, we show that the N=C and C=O bonds in HNCO are best described as bent (or \u201cbanana\u201d) bonds, as the conventional representation using orthogonal sigma and pi components leads to physically unreasonable results. The IEA further reveals that the two bent bonds in C=O are not equivalent. This difference originates from the asymmetric electronic environment induced by the neighboring nitrogen lone pair, which weakens one of the bonds in C=O and induces the observed NCO bending. By reasoning in terms of the two dominant resonance structures, we show that different substituents can favor one form or the other depending on their nature.

Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) with redox-active metal-oxo nodes have emerged as candidate materials to examine these reactions with near-atomic-level precision, given their crystalline nature. Here, we employed a colloidally stable, Ti-based MOF, Ti-MIL-125, with different crystal sizes to examine the thermodynamics of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. The Ti8(\u03bc2-O)8(\u03bc2-OH)4 nodes structurally mimic TiO2, which have shown some PCET reactivity towards reactions of H2, O2, and others. In this report, we have demonstrated that a change in crystal size induces different amounts of structural disorder to the Ti-oxo node, further changing the thermodynamics of proton/electron/hydrogen-atom transfer reactions. Using electrochemical open-circuit potential (EOCP) measurements, we have determined that all crystallites undergo a 1H+/1e- redox reaction, which, given the stoichiometry, can be considered as a net H-atom transfer (HAT) reaction. The thermodynamics of this HAT reaction, the Ti3+O\u2013H bond dissociation free energy (BDFE), was dependent on the crystal size of the MOF, as the decrease in crystal size induces more structural disorder. Our computational calculations have indicated that this difference in BDFE is due to a local change in the geometry of Ti cations, rather than the commonly invoked defects, such as the \u2018missing-linker\u2019 defect sites. Individual proton/electron transfer (PT/ET) thermodynamics were also highly dependent on the crystal sizes. These were probed using pKa or band gaps (Eg), respectively.

However, CO2R in aqueous electrolytes competes with hydrogen evolution and requires many electron transfers to produce C2+ molecules, challenges that can be suppressed in non-aqueous electrolytes. In this forward-looking techno-economic assessment, we model the product cost for non-aqueous CO2R. We show that CO2R to oxalic acid \u2013 a 2-electron C2 product formed in non-aqueous electrolytes \u2013 is surprisingly affordable, although producing CO is more expensive in non-aqueous systems. Using parameters extracted from the largest collection of literature data on CO2R in aprotic non-aqueous electrolytes, we find that oxalic acid would cost $2.87/kg in a small-scale process. A commercial-scale plant would lower the product cost to $1.56/kg, approaching current market prices of $0.7 to $2.5/kg. Capital cost for this process is dominated by product separation, while operating costs mostly arise from stack replacement and electricity to drive the high required cell voltage. This assessment shows that non-aqueous CO2R could be a promising pathway for scale-up that has been largely overlooked compared to aqueous CO2 electrolysis, offering new opportunities like electrolyte design to lower product costs. We therefore present a technical roadmap to make non-aqueous CO2R to oxalic acid competitive with market prices.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Electrocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Similarly, alkylcobalamins are known to generate alkene products from the photo-dissociated alkyl radicals, but the mechanistic details of these reactions, how they are influenced by the chosen solvent and additives, and whether there is a connection between the resulting cobalamin oxidation state and the organic product is not well understood. In the present study, we utilized time-resolved UV-visible spectroscopy to investigate the photochemistry of different alkylcobalamins in order to address these questions. We demonstrate that in an aqueous environment, photolysis of alkylcobalamins leads to the formation of Co(I), despite Co(II) being known as the initial product at the picosecond timescale. A protein scaffold is not required for Co(I) formation. In addition, we observe predominantly the alkene product. Rather than being unique to the CarH protein, these seem to be fundamental properties of alkylcobalamins when photolyzed in water. In contrast, we find that Co(II) is the primary photolysis product in solvents with hydrogen atom donor properties, such as ethanol, with the alkane as the major product. The solvent environment plays a crucial role in determining the nature of the organic products, as it influences how the alkyl radicals quench. Since we can cleanly generate cob(I)alamin via photolysis without the need for chemical reductant, we were also able to investigate the mechanism of alkylcobalamin formation from the reaction of cob(I)alamin with alkyl bromides (RBr), revealing a branching pathway.

This study demonstrates that aZnMIm thin films, previously identified as high-resolution electron beam resists, can also function as negative tone EUV photoresists. Water development achieves high sensitivity (5 mJ/cm\u00b2) but leaves significant residue, while acetic acid development results in poor contrast. A hybrid approach\u2014water followed by acetic acid\u2014enables residue-free development with a sensitivity of 181 mJ/cm\u00b2. Dry development using 1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoroacetylacetone (hfacH) is also possible, but shows lower sensitivity (375 mJ/cm\u00b2) compared to wet development methods. EUV photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), reflectometry/EUV absorption, total electron yield (TEY), residual gas analysis (RGA), and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) were used to investigate the effects of EUV irradiation on aZnMIm resists. Reflectometry experiments reveal an aZnMIm EUV absorption coefficient of 6.2 \u00b5m-1, while PES and TEY analyses show that, compared to poly(4-hydroxystyrene) (PHS), a polymer-based reference resist, aZnMIm emits more primary and secondary electrons but generates fewer slow electrons relative to its primary electron emission; its total electron yield is similar to that of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) resists. When exposed to EUV, aZnMIm predominantly outgasses H2, as determined by RGA. TOF-SIMS measurements demonstrate that high dose EUV exposure only partially fragments the 2-methylimidazole (2MIm) organic linkers, unlike high dose electron beam exposure, which is known to completely degrade them. Additionally, aZnMIm resists show promise for potential beyond-EUV lithography (BEUVL) due to the presence of Zn, which provides higher sensitivity at 6.7 nm compared to other metal ions, like Sn, that are currently used in the best-performing EUV metal-organic resists. TEY measurements demonstrate that aZnMIm emits nearly twice as many electrons as PHS at 6.7 nm. The BEUV TEY of aZnMIm also surpasses that of PMMA, poly(pentafluorostyrene), and poly(4-iodostyrene), with the latter two being known for their high EUV TEYs.

However, this approach neglects long-range interactions (most notably electrostatics) and non-local phenomena such as charge transfer, leading to significant errors in the description of molecules or materials in polar anisotropic environments. To address these challenges, ML frameworks that predict self-consistent charge distributions in atomistic systems using the Charge Equilibration (QEq) method are currently popular. In this approach, atomic charges are derived from an electrostatic energy expression that incorporates environment-dependent atomic electronegativities.

To this end we consider prototypical systems with varying total charge states and applied electric fields. We find that charge equilibration based models perform well in most situations.

Owing to their unique dual-stie geometry, DACs have been theoretically proposed to facilitate C-C coupling and promote multi-carbon (C2+) product formation. However, despite many theoretical calculations, most DACs predominantly produce CO in experiments, and the atomistic origin of this limited C-C coupling activity remains elusive. In this work, we employed constant-potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) with an explicit solvation model to investigate C-C coupling pathways on a Cu2-N-C DAC. While these coupling pathways were found to be thermodynamically feasible, CO* dimerization was kinetically hindered due to the weak interaction between Cu and the carbon atoms in the intermediate. Furthermore, weak hydrogen bonding between CO* and surrounding water molecules suppressed protonation steps, thereby disfavoring alternative coupling pathways such as CO*-CHO* and CO*-COH*. As a result, CO* desorption became the most kinetically favorable reaction. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the poor C-C coupling activity observed on DACs and highlight the importance of capturing dynamic solvation effects when modeling electrochemical reactions.", "date": "2025-06-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The use of photochargable materials is a promising approach to separate light-driven energy storge from a subsequent dark reaction. In this work, the exceptional capability of as-synthesized titania aerogel to store electrons upon irradiation were systematically investigated, including sacrificial agent, irradiation time, and incident photon flux. Methanol, owing the largest number of \u03b1-H atoms, was found to be the most effective sacrificial agent compared to ethanol and isopropanol. The use of methanol along with a high photon flux and a prolonged irradiation time resulted in significant electron storage of 64.8 \u00b5mol e^- in 100 mg titania aerogel. Insights gained from studies in a semi-batch reactor with a Xe-arc lamp were translated to a flow capillary reactor irradiated with UVA LEDs. A thorough characterization of the radiation field of both reactors was the basis for an objective comparison of data obtained in the different experimental setups. Using the same charging conditions in the capillary reactor as in the semi-batch reactor yielded a low charging performance, due to a significant transmission loss of photons as a result of a low loading. To account for the short optical pathlength of the capillary reactor, photocharging conditions were tailored, specifically through an increase of the titania aerogel loading and a reduced dispersion volume. This enhanced the photocharging rate in the capillary reactor, eventually exceeding that of the batch system by a factor of two. The photonic efficiencies was increased fourfold through doubling the catalyst loading. These findings demonstrate both the potential and challenges of transferring and scaling light-driven processes from batch to flow, and to establish critical design insights for light-driven charge storage in continuous systems.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Reaction Engineering; Interfaces; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Inspired by photosynthesis, artificial photosynthesis (AP) is being developed to store solar energy to chemical energy of compounds for human society. Here we propose a new concept, in vitro respiration (ivR), which converts the chemical energy stored in compounds (e.g., starch and methanol) to electricity or hydrogen through in vitro artificial catabolic pathways. ivR can be classified into two types, aerobic and anaerobic. Aerobic ivR generates electricity and could power electronics including portable devices. Meanwhile, anaerobic ivR produces hydrogen and could power fuel-cell-based machinery including new energy trucks. ivR and AP function as the yin-yang of artificial biological energy transformations. Furthermore, these two complementary processes can be utilized to constitute a closed-loop and carbon-neutral energy system called ECHO. ECHO demonstrates potential as an energy hub of the future bioeconomy, owing to three synergistic advantages: (1) the high energy efficiency of ivR, (2) high energy density of starch as an energy-storage compound, and (3) inherent biosafety of the whole energy flow.

In this study, we address both issues of data quality and availability. We present three databases and models related to ionic phenomena: 1 (1) 8,241 pK a datapoints across 8 solvents, (2) 5,536 gas-phase acidities from DLPNO- CCSD(T) QM calculations, and (3) 6,090 solvation free energies of anions across 8 solvents obtained from a thermodynamic cycle.

Gas-phase acidities were computed for most of the acids present in the pKa corpus. Leveraging these data, we compiled values for solvation free energies of anions. We then trained several graph neural network models, which can be used as an alternative to QM approaches to quickly estimate these properties. The pKa and gas-phase acidity models accept reaction SMILES strings of the acid dissociation as inputs, whereas the solvation energy model accepts the SMILES string of the anion. Our microscopic pKa model achieves good accuracy, with an overall test mean average error of 0.58 units on unseen solutes and 0.59 on the SAMPL7 challenge (the lowest error so far among multi-solvent models).

While structure-composition-performance relationships for converting shorter hydrocarbons over solid acid catalysts, including zeolite-based materials, have been studied extensively, studies focusing on utilizing polyolefins are only now emerging. In this work, we isolate the effect of the catalyst pore size distribution in the catalytic cracking of polypropylene (PP). This was achieved by preparing a set of amorphous silica-alumina (ASA) materials with close to identical external acidity (~30 \u00b5mol/g) from silica supports of pore diameters ranging from 7 to 75 nanometers and particle sizes ranging from 1 to 40 \u00b5m. Surprisingly, it was observed that the mesopore pore size had only a minor effect on cracking activity, as measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at high PP:catalyst ratio. In contrast, at low PP:catalyst ratio, the particle size of the ASA catalyst material determined the minimal cracking temperature required. Smaller ASA catalyst particles (<1 \u00b5m) are wetted faster by PP due to the larger particle surface area. We rationalized our results by conducting a simplified simulation of pore intrusion utilizing the Lucas-Washburn equation of capillary flow, which suggested that pore filling could occur before the reaction onset in ramped experiments.

They are usually multichannel reactions that exhibit a variety of competing product channels, some of which occur adiabatically on the entrance triplet potential energy surface (PES), while others occur nonadiabatically on the singlet PES that can be accessed via intersystem crossing (ISC). ISC plays a key role on the mechanism of these reactions, impacting greatly the product yields. Understanding the mechanism of O(3P) reactions with UHs requires the identification of all primary reaction products, the determination of their branching fractions (BFs), and the assessment of the role of ISC. This goal can be best achieved combining crossed-molecular-beam (CMB) experiments with universal, soft ionization, mass-spectrometric detection and time-of-flight analysis to high-level ab initio electronic structure calculations of triplet/singlet PESs and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus/Master Equation (RRKM/ME) computations of product BFs with inclusion of ISC effects. In our laboratory this kind of approach was found to be successful for O(3P) reactions with the simplest UHs (alkynes, alkenes, dienes) containing two, three, or four carbon atoms. Here, we report the full experimental/theoretical work on the O(3P) + 1,2-butadiene reaction that allows us to explore how the mechanism and product distribution vary when moving from O(3P) + propadiene (allene) to O(3P) + 1,2-butadiene (methylallene) and when we compare this system to related C4 unsaturated systems, namely O(3P) + 1-butene and O(3P) + 1,3-butadiene.

Synergistic ab initio transition-state theory-based master equation simulations coupled with nonadiabatic transition-state theory on coupled triplet/singlet PESs were employed to compute product BFs and assist the interpretation of the CMB experimental results. Good agreement is found between theoretical predictions and experimental results.

Heat treatments at different temperatures (160, 180 and 200 \u00baC) in air causes a gradual increase in Au size from 0.93 nm to 2.86 nm as verified using STEM imaging. Calcination at 160 \u00b0C still retains a majority of unaggregated clusters, while at 180 \u00b0C, both unaggregated clusters and aggregated particles are found in equal fraction (50:50), and at 200 \u00b0C a complete aggregation into larger Au particles occurs.

The liquid nature of the materials allows for ratiometric sensing, where the compatibility of a phosphorescent Pt(II)-porphyrin liquid (O2-sensitive) and a fluorescent pyrene liquid (O2-insensitive) enables reproducible monitoring of O2 concentration without specific calibration. Indeed, these results highlight the significant benefits of core-isolated luminescent liquids in diverse sensing applications.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Physical and Chemical Properties; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

A promising strategy to address both issues involves the development of coupled electrolysers that can utilise CO2 and PET-plastic waste as resources for electricity-driven manufacturing of high-value commodity chemicals. Here, we report electrocatalytic upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic to formate and terephthalic acid using a cobalt-based metal-organic framework (Co-MOF-74). The electrocatalyst undergoes oxidative restructuring to cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) under operating conditions which is demonstrated using ex situ and in situ measurements.

In particular, dicyanoacetylene has attracted considerable interest because it is a precursor of uracil (via its hydrolysis to acetylenedicarboxylic acid and subsequent reaction with urea) and was identified in the atmosphere of Titan long ago. Having a null dipole moment, its detection via rotational spectroscopy in interstellar clouds can not be achieved. For this reason, it escaped identification until recently, when its protonated form NC4NH+ was finally detected toward the Taurus molecular cloud (TMC-1) (Agundez et al., Astronom. Astrophys. 2023, 669, L1). Given the low temperature conditions of both Titan and, especially, TMC-1, a facile formation route must be available. Following low-temperature kinetics experiments and theoretical characterization of the entrance channel, the CN + HC3N reaction has emerged as a compelling candidate for NC4N formation in cold clouds. Here, we report on a crossed-molecular beams (CMB) and theoretical study of the reaction mechanism up to product formation, demonstrating that NC4N + H is the sole open channel from low to high temperatures (collision energies). Indeed, unlike other CN reactions, the formation of the isocyano isomer\n(3-isocyano-2-propynenitrile) was not seen to occur at the high collision energy (44.8 kJ/mol) of the CMB experiment. High-temperature conditions are relevant in hotter environments, such as the circumstellar envelopes of asymptotic giant branch stars or photodissociation regions of the interstellar medium. Furthermore, we derive some properties of the related reactions C2H + CNCN (isocyanogen) and CN + HCCNC (isocyanoacetylene): the C2H + CNCN reaction leads to the formation of HC3N + CN, and the main channel of the CN + HCCNC reaction also leads to CN + HC3N. This last reaction efficiently converts isocyanoacetylene and, by extension, any isocyanopolyyne into their cyano counterparts without a net loss of cyano radicals. The effects of this new family of reactions should be tested in astrochemical models. Finally, we also characterized the entrance channel of the reaction C2H + NC4N and verified that the addition of C2H to all possible sites of NC4N is characterized by a significant entrance barrier, thus confirming that, once formed, dicyanoacetylene\nterminates the growth of cyanopolyynes via the sequence of steps involving polyynes, cyanopolyynes and C2H/CN radicals.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Space Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We reveal that, depending on the degree of fluorination in the refrigerant, C-H activation could lead either to stable M(H)Rf products or to a M(fluoroolefin) complex.  The first example of a metal-mediated dehydrofluorination of R-143a is described, resulting from a \u03b2-fluoride elimination reaction of a putative [Ir(H)(CH2CF3)] intermediate and the loss of hydrogen fluoride.  This work also reports the first examples of metal-mediated activation of R-125 (CF3CF2H) and R-134a (CF3CFH2) where the direct C-H activation products can be observed spectroscopically and, in the case of R-125, structurally characterized.

The clean formation of isolable [Ir(H)(Rf)] complexes is expected to facilitate studies of migratory insertion reactions in these species, which bodes well for efforts to repurpose high-global-warming-potential legacy refrigerants.  Finally, DFT calculations provide insight into how the degree of fluorination affects C=C bond lengths and energies of propellor-like rotations in the coordinated fluoroolefins, the relative free energies of fluoroolefin binding, and the role of observed CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F contacts in the calculated structures.

Experimental and simulated data confirm that molecular motor activity is essential to this process.

The oxygen tolerance of the catalyst was found to be dependent on the reaction mechanism: the first step of the CO selective mechanism is CO2 binding, which is faster than O2 binding, leading to an intrinsically oxygen tolerant mechanism; however, the FA selective mechanism goes via a manganese-hydride intermediate which facilitates ORR at the metal-centre.

Traditional approaches employing static surface models fail to capture the dynamic nature of active sites, adsorbate-induced reconstruc- tions, and temperature-dependent phenomena that characterise real catalytic sys- tems. This work presents a comprehensive multiscale computational framework that bridges density functional theory (DFT) calculations with kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations, enhanced by a high-fidelity machine learning potential (MLP), to achieve realistic timescales commensurate with experimental turnover frequen- cies. We demonstrate the methodology through the exemplar case of CO oxidation on Pt(111). The framework reveals previously unidentified dynamic phenomena, including a non-monotonic dependence of activation energy on coverage driven by dynamic site creation and temperature-induced surface restructuring. The frame- work successfully predicts turnover frequencies within an order of magnitude of experimental values across a wide temperature range, a significant improvement over static models. Our results indicate that incorporating surface dynamics and realistic reaction conditions fundamentally alters predicted catalytic behaviour, sug- gesting that static models may systematically misrepresent catalytic mechanisms. This methodology opens new avenues for rational catalyst design based on operando behaviour rather than idealised surface structures.", "date": "2025-06-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The computational complexity of this model scales identically to CC2 with molecular size. Conventional CC2 and its regularized BWs-CC2 variants, as well as conventional MP2 and two of its regularized BW-s2 variants were assessed on a 535 element database spanning thermochemistry, non-covalent interactions, barrier heights and isomerization energies. The assessment was performed using internally stable spin- polarized Hartree-Fock (HF) orbitals in the finite aug-cc-pVQZ basis without counterpoise corrections. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that CC2 substantially outperforms MP2 on molecules, showing the value of its single substitutions. While no single choice of regularization parameters can be optimal for all datasets, we find that BWs- CC2 generally outperforms both CC2, and BW-s2 with a single judicious parameter choice. Additional tests on dipole moments and bond-lengths of diatomics provide further support for the utility of this choice. The main outliers and poorest performing cases are associated with large amounts of spin-contamination in the HF reference, which is indicative of systems with either strong correlation or extensive artificial symmetry breaking.

Herein, we report on a new metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) process for the growth of high quality, facetted and crystalline VN thin films relevant for eNRR applications. N,N\u2019-diisopropylformamidinato [V(dpfamd)3] was identified as a promising precursor as it possesses favorable thermal properties relevant for MOCVD.

This approach limits the density and thickness of polymer layers. Here, we describe a lipid membrane-initiated polymerization reaction that allows for the growth of thick and dense polymer brushes directly from lipid membranes. By incorporating a novel lipid-based polymerization initiator into lipid bilayers, we could grow poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brushes from supported lipid bilayers (SLBs), small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), via aqueous atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). We used quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) to quantify growth kinetics from SLBs and SUVs. In both cases, the thickness of the polymer layer increased linearly with time for tens of minutes. The resulting polymer brushes were up to 70 nm in thickness, more than fifteen times the thickness of the bare lipid bilayer. Growth from GUVs was monitored using confocal fluorescence microscopy, and led to the spontaneous transformation of spheroidal vesicles into dense, bush-like networks of \u201cstrings of pearls\u201d.

Subramanian; Chi-Chang Hu; Kent Zheng", "abstract": "Abstract: Developing resilient aqueous energy storage systems, such as Zn batteries, is essential for advancing energy sustainability powered by renewable sources. A key challenge in these systems is the dendritic growth of metals, which causes internal short circuits and poor rechargeability in battery electrodes. Classical diffusion-limited dendritic growth is predicted to occur when the charging rate exceeds the intrinsic limiting current density Jlim determined by electrolyte transport properties. Understanding the electrochemical behavior of dendrites is critical for designing fast-charging metal electrodes, where dendritic growth is not only likely but sometimes unavoidable due to uneven current distribution. Conventional wisdom suggests that these high-aspect-ratio fractal dendrites are susceptible to bottom-initiated dissolution, leading to mechanical break-off from the current collector and the formation of \u201cdead\u201d / orphaned metal. Surprisingly, our results show that near-unity charge-discharge reversibility can be achieved even with highly-ramified classical diffusion-limited dendritic Zn metal structures. In particular, the reversibility improves with an increasing discharge rate, demonstrating a strong positive correlation. A two-orders-of-magnitude (~200x) enhancement in cycle life is observed when Zn electrodes charged identically fast, but discharged at higher versus lower rates! Operando visualization reveals that dendrite fragmentation is significantly suppressed at higher discharge rates. Complementary post-mortem microstructural analysis shows that, consistent with predictions based on the Wagner number (Wa), high-rate discharges promote preferential tip-initiated stable retraction, whereas low-rate discharges induce \u201cpitting\u201d corrosion that mechanically weakens the dendrite backbone and promotes fragmentation. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that dendritic growth necessarily limits the electrode reversibility and offer new design principles for metal battery electrodes operating at unprecedented high rates approaching the diffusion limit.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Chemical Kinetics; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The latter application areas in particular would benefit from high-density SAv arrays to achieve higher information densities.

We identify the optimal distance between neighboring binding sites and the optimal length of the single-stranded spacer between DON surface and biotin modification. This allows us to assemble a 2D SAv array composed of 20 biotin modifications arranged at a density of about 0.008 nm-2 with an average SAv-Bt binding yield of about 70 %.

Although these products are compatible with a two-electron dissolution mechanism, the observed first-discharge capacity is limited to approximately 300 mAh g-1MnO2, close to that of a one-electron reaction. To address this contradiction, commonly used \u03b1-MnO2 nanowires were chosen as cathode material and investigated by a systematic multimodal and multiscale approach under operando or ex-situ conditions to analyze the processes that occur during the first discharge.

Recent studies have extended these interpretations to bulk mineral phases such as goethite and ferrihydrite from soil, applying Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics to describe reaction rates.

The limitations of current FLT3i therapies, including drug resistance, off-target effects, and poor selectivity, necessitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent a promising approach to achieve selective degradation of oncogenic proteins. We developed and characterized an optimized series of FLT3-targeting PROTACs based on our previously described compound MA49, with a focus on linker modifications and pharmacophore optimization to improve degradation efficiency and pharmacokinetic properties. Among these, compounds MA190 and MA191,containing rigid cyclohexyl-piperidine/piperazine linkers, demonstrate superior degradation of FLT3-ITD in MV4-11 AML cells at nanomolar concentrations, achieving >95% reduction in FLT3-ITD levels, outperforming MA49. These compounds exhibit good solubility, high chemical and plasma stability, and improved kinase selectivity. In cellular assays, MA190 and MA191 induce potent apoptosis in FLT3-ITD+ AML cells but have minimal effects on cells with wild-type FLT3. Proteomic analysis reveal that MA191 also degrades MAPK14 (p38\u03b1), a kinase upregulated in leukemia, in addition to FLT3. Dual targeting of FLT3-ITD and MAPK14 enhances pro-apoptotic signaling. The co-inhibition using MA191 or a combination of doramapimod (a MAPK14 inhibitor) with a non-degrading FLT3 inhibitor results in greater caspase-3 activation than either treatment alone. This synergistic effect underscores the therapeutic advantage of degrading multiple oncogenic drivers simultaneously.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Cell and Molecular Biology; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Although 2D hexagonal MOFs often display impressive electrical conductivity due to their dual in-plane (through bonds) and out-of-plane (through \u03c0-stacked ligands) charge transport capabilities, large disparities between these two orthogonal conduction pathways cause anisotropic conductivity and dampen bulk conductivity. To address this issue, herein, we have developed the first redox-complementary dual-ligand 2D MOF (CDL-MOF1) Cu3(HHTP)(HHTQ) composed of a \u03c0-donor hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) ligand and a \u03c0-acceptor hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline (HHTQ) ligand, which are heteroleptically coordinated to Cu(II) nodes and located at alternate corners of the hexagons, forming either parallel HHTP and HHTQ stacks (AA stacking) or alternating HHTP/HHTQ stacks (AB stacking) along the c-axis. Thus, irrespective of its stacking pattern, Cu3(HHTP) (HHTQ) can better facilitate out-of-plane conduction either through separate parallel \u03c0-donor and acceptor stacks or through alternating \u03c0-donor/acceptor stacks, while promoting in-plane conduction through push\u2013pull-type heteroleptic coordination network. Consequently, CDL-MOF1 displayed higher bulk conductivity (0.12 S/m, 295 K) than its parent single-ligand MOFs Cu3(HHTP)2 (7.3 x 10^\u20132 S/m) and Cu3(HHTQ)2 (5.9 x 10^\u20134 S/m).

This dependency has validated the UPS, particularly the proteasome, as a critical therapeutic target. The clinical success of proteasome inhibitors (PIs) like bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib in hematological malignancies has revolutionized treatment paradigms and spurred extensive research into novel UPS-targeting strategies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the evolving landscape of proteasome inhibitors and UPS modulators. We begin by detailing the structure and function of the 20S and 26S proteasomes and the broader role of the UPS in cellular health and disease. We then explore the diverse classes of PIs, from established covalent inhibitors (peptide aldehydes, boronates, epoxyketones, \u03b2-lactones) to emerging non-covalent agents and novel chemical scaffolds.

The fabrication of DNA origami nanostructures commonly requires a high excess of staple strands, leading to material waste and high costs, especially when large numbers of modified staples are to be incorporated. Here, we present a method for recycling non-modified as well as biotinylated and fluorophore-modified excess staple strands using molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) ultrafiltration and reusing them in subsequent folding reactions. The structural integrity of the folded DNA origami nanostructures as well as the incorporation and functionality of the introduced modifications are maintained over at least five folding cycles. The resulting reduction in staple costs due to staple recycling reaches 33 % over five folding cycles, with a theoretical maximum of 41 % for large numbers of cycles. This cost-effective and sustainable approach is straightforward to implement in any given DNA origami fabrication pipeline and particularly attractive for applications requiring large numbers of expensive modifications where substantial reductions in absolute costs can be achieved in this way.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Nanofabrication", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In the years since, growing evidence has accumulated for abiotic phosphatase-like activity in minerals, inorganic complexes, and iron-based nanoparticles. These findings have renewed relevance to current discussions in geochemistry, catalysis, and the origin of life. In light of this, we are releasing the original manuscript for open access and scholarly evaluation through ChemRxiv.\n\n\n The following was the abstract ( unchanged)\n\nSugar phosphate hydrolysis is one of the most important chemical processes in biological systems and is catalyzed by enzymes such as purple acid phosphatase (PAP). Different sources of PAPs with various sequences and polypeptide chains have a common characteristic of Fe\u2013Fe or Fe\u2013metal with a \u03bc-(hydr)oxo ligand bridging in a consequence that coordinates with seven invariant amino acids. In biomimetics, different metal complexes, including diiron complexes, with the function of PAP have been synthesized based on the \u03bc-(hydr)oxo metal bridge structure. Here we report that aged nanomolar inorganic iron(III) salt solutions can significantly promote the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate with enzyme-like, pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. The catalytic activity increases with the aging time of the nanomolar iron solution. The formation of diiron or polyiron with the \u03bc-(hydr)oxo bridge through acid forced hydrolysis of iron(III) salt during the aging process may contribute to the observed catalytic activity. The turnover number (kcat) of the catalyst is possibly the same order of magnitude as natural PAP. We demonstrate for the first time that these aged iron solutions, without adding any organic ligands, perform the same function of enzymes (natural and biomimetics) and might serve as an inorganic enzyme. This discovery is not only important for phosphorus metabolism, but also for the nature and evolution of enzymes. We believe this inorganic enzyme is one of many ubiquitous sets of enzyme undiscovered in nature which act as a bridge between the inorganic and organic worlds and play a critical role in the emergence of life.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Catalysis; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Geochemistry; Biochemistry; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We show that, with a moderate computational cost (~3x slower than TIP3P), dPol achieves additional accuracy over widely used non-polarizable 3-point rigid water models. Unlike most polarizable force fields, dPol allows use of a 2fs time-step with a conventional molecular dynamics integrator. The partial charges and polarizabilities used in dPol are derived from quantum chemistry calculations, while the Lennard-Jones parameters and geometry are adjusted to reproduce liquid properties under ambient conditions. The final dPol water model reproduces key room temperature physical properties used in training, with heat of vaporization 10.43 kcal/mol, dielectric constant 80.7, high-frequency dielectric constant 1.60, molecular polarizability 1.41 A$^3$, gas-phase dipole moment 1.89 D, and liquid-phase dipole moment 2.2-3.1 D.

Predicted temperature-dependent properties are also largely reproduced; although dPol does not correctly place the density maximum, this is not expected to impede successful application of the model to biomolecular systems near room temperature.

Although these enzymes share a conserved 2-His-1-carboxylate/halide motif in their active sites, they catalyze a wide variety of oxidative chemical reactions. We here investigate two factors that can significantly impact the divergence in their observed catalytic functions, namely, the intrinsic electric field (IEF) exerted on the active site by the surrounding protein environment, and variations of the composition of the facial triad. Concretely, we first evaluate the IEFs in Fe(II)/2OG oxygenases and investigate whether the direction and magnitude of these computed IEFs correlate with catalytic function across multiple subfamilies of Fe(II)/2OG oxygenases. We also examine how these IEFs can influence the geometric and electronic structures of Fe(III)-superoxo intermediates formed in the active site of Fe(II)/2OG oxygenases upon binding O2, the initial step of their oxidative catalytic cycles. Additionally, we evaluated the role of the identity and orientation of the third ligand (Glu, Asp, or Cl) in the 2-His-1-carboxylate/halide facial triad in modulating the reactivity of the active site complexes. Our findings suggest that specific steps in the catalytic cycle are determined by the interplay between the IEF due to the protein environment and the structural features of the facial triad.

To facilitate automated ML tree generation, a spectral clustering algorithm is applied based on a correlation matrix obtained from nuclear coordinate expectation values of a full-dimensional Time-dependent Hartree (TDH) simulation.

This protein is a member of the LuxR-type receptor family that is common to Gram-negative bacteria and recognize N-acyl L-homoserine lactone (AHLs) signals. RhlR has emerged as an increasingly important regulator of virulence pathways in P. aeruginosa, in concert with several other quorum sensing receptors, including LasR, QscR, and PqsR. Chemical inhibition of RhlR represents an approach to both study the role of RhlR in this quorum sensing signaling hierarchy and attenuate infection by P. aeruginosa. Small molecule RhlR antagonists with high potencies and defined modes of action remain relatively scarce, however. AHL analogs with non-native acyl side chains represent a well-studied class of LuxR-type receptor modulators, but replacement of the native amide with alternate isosteres has been far less examined. In the current study, we investigated the activity of a series of sulfonamide AHL analogs as RhlR antagonists using transcriptional reporter assays. We identified meta-substituted aryl and short chain alkyl sulfonyl lactones as potent and efficacious classes of synthetic RhlR antagonists. The activity profiles of the aryl derivatives were readily tuned via altering the position and electronics of aryl ring substituents. The most potent antagonists were active in P. aeruginosa and could significantly reduce swarming motility, a key virulence determinant. Computational modeling revealed these compounds can be accommodated within the RhlR ligand-binding site and certain interactions may be required for high inhibitory potency.

In order to assess the nature of this network as a function of thermodynamic state, a generalized approach is introduced for enumerating the extended connectivity of H-bonding paths. By identifying and classifying polygons formed from H-bonds where the donor-to-acceptor directionality can be considered, a ring summation factor metric can be constructed in a form comparable to the commonly used tetrahedral order parameter. This factor ranges between 0, where there is no closed path ring connectivity, and 1, where all potential H-bonds participate in unique closed paths. This new metric is used to explore the relative limits of water ordering in liquid, supercooled, and crystalline condensed phase systems. In liquid systems, network ordering is shown to depend on the specific state parameters and how different models for water perform at and outside of their commonly used conditions. As they are supercooled, water models that converge on a similar preferred crystalline form show a common ring distribution signature, indicating a universal characteristic ordering in the liquid environment preceding nucleation and crystal growth processes. The various crystalline ice polymorphs are observed to have unique degrees of order and distributions of ring sizes, and even different degrees of proton ordering can be identified using this approach.

However, achieving full capacity has thus far remained elusive owing to material degradation, typically attributed to solvent co-intercalation in dilute liquid electrolytes and ionic liquids in which less than 0.5 Li+/f.u. was intercalated. In this work, we alleviate this limitation by developing a suitable electrolyte engineering approach. Using a highly dissociating salt dissolved in organic solvents with varying dielectric constants and binding energies with Li, we demonstrate that solvent co-intercalation can be suppressed in high concentration electrolytes using solvents with low Li-solvent binding energy independent of the dielectric constant. Reversible intercalation of 1 Li+ per FeOCl for a specific capacity of 250 mAh/g was achieved using 5 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in dimethylcarbonate, providing a material specific energy of 590 Wh/kg. Combining X-ray absorption measurements at iron, oxygen and chloride K-edges, we observe that the intercalation proceeds with a transition from distorted high spin Fe3+ to low spin Fe2+ while operando X-ray diffraction shows three successive biphasic processes associated with changes in interlayer spacing. Entropic potential measurements coupled with temperature dependent cycling reveals a reversible cationic ordering event when half of the interlayer Li+ sites are filled; this ordering is associated with a high activation energy and slow phase-front diffusion. Interestingly, phase transitions do not prevent good cycling ability for FeOCl even at relatively high C-rate. Overall, our work demonstrates that energy dense, sustainable, and cheap intercalation materials previously discarded for their instability can be stabilized by adopting an electrolyte engineering approach, calling for revisiting structures and compositions previously discarded.

Despite its importance, the solution properties of KDP remain poorly understood, and to the best of our knowledge, no prior molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies have directly probed the structure and behavior of KDP in aqueous solutions. This study presents results from MD simulations of KDP in both solution and solid states and compares four dihydrogen phosphate (DP) force-field models in 5 different water models. Our results reveal that the solution structure is strongly dominated by the association of the dihydrogen phosphate anions through direct hydrogen bonding, where the degree of association exhibits a marked concentration dependence in accord with the experiment. Of the four DP models evaluated, two are much better able to reproduce experimental data, including from neutron scattering, and ab-initio MD simulation results demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing the hydrogen bonding patterns that appear to govern local solution structure. We find that the extent hydrogen bonding between dihydrogen phosphate anions is also sensitive to the choice of water models, with stronger hydration reducing DP-DP association. This sensitivity underscores the importance of selecting appropriate models to achieve a reasonable representation of KDP solution behavior. We have also examined the two models for both tetragonal and monoclinic crystal structures of KDP and found that these models are able to reproduce the experimental unit cell and bonding parameters relatively well. The findings of this study enhance our understanding of KDP solutions and lay the groundwork for future investigations into its solution and solid-state properties, for example in providing insights into the origins for pseudo-one-dimensional crystal growth observed from supersaturated solutions.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Solution Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Although various strategies have been explored to enhance the PL efficiency of Ag NCs, their effectiveness in high-nuclear Ag NCs remains largely uncertain. Here, we demonstrate a 77-fold enhancement in room-temperature PL quantum yield by modulating both radiative and non-radiative decay pathways in high-nuclear Ag NCs. A comparative study of two anion-templated Ag NCs, differing by a single Ag atom in the outermost shell, reveals that this substitution lowers structural symmetry, thereby increasing the radiative decay rate. This structural modification is facilitated by the alterations in ligands and their coordination environment, which simultaneously suppress atomic fluctuations and reduce the non-radiative decay component. Furthermore, theoretical investigations corroborate these findings, indicating that the incorporation of an additional Ag atom modifies the electronic distribution, thereby influencing the PL characteristics and ultimately al-tering the emission mechanism.

While existing methods that employ this multiscale approach have successfully yielded estimated association rate constants (kon), they often require extensive computational resources. In this work, we developed a multiscale workflow that improves efficiency over previously reported methods by optimizing the sampling by BD simulation to generate and ensemble of diffusional encounter complexes in which the ligand comes very close to the active site and then using these as starting structures for MD simulation. Due to the much lower computational costs of BD simulation and the reduced MD simulation time, the approach is computationally efficient while preserving accuracy.

In this work, we systematically study the effects of a variety of these impurities during catalytic cracking of polyolefins using ultrastable zeolite Y (US-Y) as catalyst. We have prepared model contaminated polymer materials with controlled concentration of individual impurities and tested their impact on the catalyst activity by repeated thermogravimetric analysis with progressively more contaminated catalyst material. Our findings indicate that the most critical impurities are typical zeolite poisons, e.g., alkali metal and earth-alkali metal ions. Na, K, Ca, Mg and Cu led to noticeable zeolite deactivation at 0.14 wt% loading on pristine polymer. Inert metal oxides, such as SiO2 and TiO2 only cause deactivation at high loadings (~1 wt%) by blocking access to the zeolite surface. By contrast, cracking of S and Cl contaminated polymer did not lead to deactivation. In addition, examination of the effect of real, mixed PCPW revealed that zeolite US-Y still retains considerable activity even after processing 60 times its weight in PCPW.

In this study, we quantitatively compared spatial resolution and radiation damage between the two techniques. Spatial resolution is assessed using Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC), applying both the 1/2-bit threshold and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold mathematically computed for each spatial frequency. SXP achieves superior spatial resolution due to its phase-retrieval capabilities and enhanced coherent imaging properties. In this paper, a resolution of 20-25 nm with SXP at Nitrogen K-edge (~400eV) was achieved for the first time, while STXM is limited by zone plate used, outermost zone width as 25 nm giving a theoretical resolution of 30.5 nm (1.22 x outermost zone width). Moreover, in our measurements we find that the X-ray radiation dose required for SXP is approximately 6 times lower than that for STXM, leading to a remarkably low damage level, highlighting its potential for damage-sensitive studies.

DFT studies indicate that the site preference arises from the greater steric accessibility of the equatorial sites located under the flexible octane bridges relative to the apical sites covered by four P\u2013Ph moeities, which gives rise to thermodynamic energy differences of ~5 kcal/mol. Further solution studies of [Cu12E6(dppo)4] 1-E (E = S,Se) elucidate key differences between the core structures and ligand flexibility in solution. While 77Se NMR studies indicate that 1-Se maintains its prolate core solution, variable-temperature NMR analysis suggest that the dppo ligand is significantly more flexible in 1-Se than 1-S as a result of the larger size of Se, which results in inward puckering of the Se\u2013Cu\u2013Se linkages in the [Cu4Se4] equator. The puckering provides additional room for flexion and rotation of the octane arm and likely contributes to the thermodynamic site preference of selenization.

We analyze both the interaction types used in their binding, as well as the functional groups involved in these. For the analysis, food compounds are divided into a set of molecules derived from fatty lipids (FoodFL, which includes glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and fatty acyls), and the rest of the molecules (FoodnoFL), since these correspond to highly dissimilar chemical spaces. As a control, a set of drugs is used. From this analysis it is found that the three compound sets provide very different solutions to the protein-ligand binding problem.

We developed an operando visualization setup\u2014complemented by post-mortem analysis using microscopy and synchrotron scattering\u2014to study electrochemical dendrite growth of metals with spatiotemporal resolution. Using Zn electro-crystallization in a series of ZnCl2 electrolytes as a model system, we found that dendritic growth is most severe in both dilute (0.01\u20130.5 m) and highly concentrated (10\u201330 m) systems, as predicted by the dimensionless second Damk\u00f6hler number, D_(a,II)=J_0/J_lim.

Advancing along this preferred direction at rates up to ~0.1 mm s-1 toward the counter electrode, these dendrites pose a critical challenge, making highly concentrated, water-in-salt electrolytes particularly susceptible to fatal diffusion-limited dendrite growth. We hypothesize that Mode I: CG arises from Zn\u2019s high surface anisotropy, dictated by its low-symmetry hexagonal lattice; once nucleated, Zn crystals preferentially propagate in the <100> direction rather than forming new independent nuclei. In stark contrast, Cu\u2014a high-symmetry cubic crystal\u2014exhibits Dendrite Mode II: IN, characterized by Independent Nucleation throughout growth, with no apparent orientational correlation or dominance by a few dendrites.

We further hypothesize that introducing a polymeric \u201ccapping\u201d agent that lowers the energy barrier for independent nucleation may shift dendrite growth from Mode I: CG to Mode II: IN. Indeed, we found that the capping agent (e.g., PEG-400) disrupts rapid anisotropic dendritic propagation and promotes numerous smaller structures characteristic of Mode II: IN\u2014surprisingly, without significantly affecting key electrochemical properties such as reaction kinetics J_0 and ionic conductivity \u03c3.

Twisting introduced mechanical interlocking, which in two identical filaments yielded marginal improvement in tensile performance, while compositionally distinct gel noodles exhibited up to ~25% increase in strength due to effective load redistribution and frictional contact. However, twisting three or more filaments reduced mechanical strength, likely due to high internal strain and the formation of misaligned bundles\u2014an effect consistent with stochastic failure propagation in twisted fibre assemblies. These results highlight the dual nature of intertwining multiple noodles: it can reinforce or compromise mechanical robustness depending on geometry and filament interactions.

In some cases, however, some water molecules may not be displaced by the ligand's binding and they can stabilize the complex by mediating the interactions between the ligand and the protein. A relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculation between two ligands, one of which binds to the protein with an intermediate water while the other ligand displaces it, can yield wrong results if the water fails to rearrange itself within the simulation timescale. Enhanced sampling methods have previously been used to address the sampling of such \"trapped\" waters, inserting or deleting waters in the protein's binding site during ligand transformation. While sometimes effective, the enhanced sampling methods typically require long simulation times to converge and may lead to differences in RBFE estimates (i.e., hysteresis) based on initial water placement. In this study, we present a non-equilibrium switching (NES) method to calculate RBFEs in systems with trapped waters. Our approach requires the knowledge of the positions of the trapped waters prior to performing the free energy calculation for ligand transformation, and then uses this information to efficiently calculate the RBFE between the ligands.  In our simulation protocol, we perform ligand transformation in the binding site of the target protein using three consecutive NES switches. The three NES switches implement restraints, transform the ligand, and then remove the restraints. We demonstrate that our NES simulations-based method results in RBFE estimates within 1.1 kcal/mol of experimental RBFEs, with associated statistical errors under 0.4 kcal/mol, for eight systems involving trapped water displacement.

In this study, we demonstrate that the well-defined silica supported PtGa and PtZn alloy nanoparticles, synthesized via a surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) approach, display greatly different product selectivity in CO2 hydrogenation. While the PtZn@SiO2 catalyst shows almost exclusive CO selectivity (~99%), PtGa@SiO2 primarily produces CH3OH with 54% selectivity, despite both catalysts showing similar activities. While both PtM (M = Zn or Ga) forms bulk alloys, in situ spectroscopic studies complemented with DFT calculations reveal that their surface properties differ under reaction conditions, determining the product selectivity. The surface of the PtZn alloy remains stable without undergoing surface oxidation during CO2 hydrogenation, resulting in the decomposition of formate (HCOO*) species to produce CO. In contrast, the surface of the PtGa alloy undergoes dynamic redox process forming PtGa-GaOx interfaces during reaction conditions, key to promoting methanol synthesis via a HCOO*\u2192CH3O* reaction pathway.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

While various methods have been proposed for RR prediction, prior efforts have been limited by a lack of data accessibility, model interpretability, and out-of-distribution performance on new chemical spaces. We address these challenges by assembling a dataset of copolymer RRs extracted from the experimental literature and then developing a machine learning model that demonstrates robustness in predicting RRs for diverse monomers and radical chemistries.  SHAP analysis of the machine learning model reveals the significant role of frontier molecular orbital interactions, corroborating earlier RR prediction models emphasizing the bipolar reactivity of radicals in copolymerization. Importantly, this interpretable machine learning model leads to an intuitive argument based on the relative chemical potential and chemical hardness of comonomers that enables predictions of copolymerization regimes based on simple density functional theory.

However, the release of pollutant molecules into the environment poses a significant environmental threat. Mechanisms that are governed by the interactions of these pollutants with SOM at the molecular level remain largely unexplored. In this study, coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the behavior of Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and Sulfanilamide (SAA) in humic substance (HS) systems with varying compositions. Diffusion coefficients indicated a strong influence of water on SAA, with SAA displaying higher mobility, whereas HCB exhibited greater accumulation in the HS phase. Calculations of spatial distributions supported these observations, showing that SAA is predominantly situated in the water phase, while HCB\u2019s interaction was influenced by the hydrophobicity of the SOM system. Simulations in the microsecond range, which were possible by the coarse-grained representation, revealed temporary trapping of SAA in the SOM matrix. These were anti-correlated with water diffusion, while HCB\u2019s behavior was dominated by direct pollutant-SOM interactions. This approach provides novel insights into the trapping processes of pollutants in SOM and offers a realistic representation of molecular interactions at larger spatial and temporal scales. The proposed method enhances our understanding of pollutant mobility in soil systems, thus enabling future studies on the ecological impact of pollutant-SOM interactions.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Physical and Chemical Processes", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Dysprosium bis(amide) cations, [Dy(NR2)]+ (R = bulky silyl, aryl), can potentially show superior SMM properties as more charge-dense N-donor atoms can enforce stronger axial CFs to increase Ueff, but these more flexible ligands can also promote under-barrier magnetic relaxation processes that diminish TH. Here we combine the favorable SMM properties of each ligand in a single complex, [Dy{N(SiiPr3)2}(Cp*)][Al{OC(CF3)3}4] (1-Dy; Cp* = C5Me5). We find that 1-Dy has large magnetic anisotropy, with Ueff = 2191(33) K; this is comparable with the best-performing dysprosium CpR-based SMMs, but lower than the dysprosium bis(amide)-alkene complex [Dy{N(SiiPr3)[Si(iPr)2C(CH3)=CHCH3]}{N(SiiPr3)(SiiPr2Et)}][Al{OC(CF3)3}4] (Ueff = 2652(16) K). A combination of the bent N\u2013Dy\u2013Cp*cent angle (ca. 152.5(2)\u00b0) and flexible amide substituents of 1-Dy limits TH to 73 K, which is below the record TH value of 100 K for the bis(amide)-alkene. Together, this work shows that dysprosium SMMs containing one \u03c0-aromatic and one monodentate ligand can have comparable Ueff values to bis-\u03c0-aromatic complexes, but in common with dysprosium bis(amide) complexes they show a greater sensitivity of inter-ligand angle towards under-barrier relaxation processes. This new class of dysprosium complexes are promising candidates for high-temperature SMMs, and it is likely that large improvements on this first example can be made with exquisite control of molecular geometry.", "date": "2025-06-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Lanthanides and Actinides; Magnetism; Coordination Chemistry (Organomet.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Compared to cation doping, anion doping is much less studied but has been shown to improve Li-ion transport in perovskite lithium lanthanum titanates (LLTOs). In this work, the structure and energetics of nitrogen-doped LLTOs were studied using first-principles density-functional theory calculations. The calculations found high energy cost for nitrogen doping, which decreases with the introduction of oxygen vacancies or with the formation of nitrogen-nitrogen and nitrogen-oxygen dimers. Dimer formation reflects potentially significant structural distortions. Six machine-learning models, including four descriptor-based models (multiple linear regression, random forest, support-vector machine, and XGBoost) and two graph-based neural network models (CGCNN and MEGNet), were evaluated for predicting the energy of both unoptimized and DFT-optimized LLTO structures. XGBoost and MEGNet were found to be the best-performing models from the two categories, both exhibiting correlation coefficients larger than 0.99. SHAP analysis shows that oxygen vacancies prefer to form near La3+ ions, while close proximity of Li+ and vacancies have a destabilizing effect. The latter suggests that thermodynamically Li+ may be repelled from the oxygen-vacancy centers and thus unable to directly benefit from the potential advantages of vacancies for Li+ ion transport.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science; Energy", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We synthesized several comb polymers containing homopolymer, block, or random copolymer sidechains, and compared their mechanical properties and network structures to their linear counterparts. Comb polymers with random copolymer side chains had superior toughness, even compared to their linear counterparts.

Working in the latent space of a generative model allows us to bypass the need for explicitly defining chemical rules when computationally designing molecules. The generation of molecules with desired properties is achieved through navigating the latent space for identifying regions that correspond to molecules with desired properties. Proximal policy optimization is a state-of-the-art policy gradient algorithm capable of operating in continuous high dimensional spaces in a sample-efficient manner.

In this study, we present the findings of the first principle calculation of alternative transition metals with the potential to compete with platinum for catalytic HER. To this end, we employed Chemdraw, Material Studio DMOL3, MATLAB, and other relevant software for the modeling and structural analysis, electronic properties, Gibbs free energy calculation, and calculation of overpotential, respectively for Co (II) and Ni (II) (E)-3-hydroxy-N\u2019-(1-(6-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-3-yl)ethylidene)-2-naphthohydrazide complexes. The investigation revealed that the Co (II) and Ni (II) complexes are ion exchange resin catalyst that exhibited a coordination number of 6, with the former displaying a tetradentate coordination and the latter exhibiting a bidentate coordination. The atomic charges indicated that the nickel (II) complex possesses seven electropositive centers, while the cobalt (II) complex has eight. The predicted carbon centers, C8, C11, C12, C15, C18, C19, C20, and C22, were identified. According to the surface energy values, Ni (II) Schiff base complexes exhibit superior efficiency for HER, attributable to their enhanced surface stability and reactivity. These properties render Ni (II) complexes more suitable for catalytic applications, whereas Co (II) complexes may necessitate further optimization to achieve comparable performance. The free energy values of the Co (II) (0.126977 eV) and Ni (II) (-0.12503 eV) Schiff base complexes indicate significant differences in their catalytic efficiency for HER. The negative free energy of the Ni (II) complex indicates that the reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases energy and proceeds spontaneously. The overpotential of Co (II) is found to be remarkably low (1.054257189511323e-25 eV), suggesting its potential to function as an ideal catalyst for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER). The negligible overpotential of cobalt renders it a promising candidate as a theoretically ideal HER catalyst due to its capacity to form stable Schiff base tetradentate ligands, thereby enhancing its electrochemical properties. Nickel, which exhibits a relatively high overpotential, remains a viable and cost-effective option for practical applications. However, further investigation is necessary to validate the performance of cobalt, which exhibits an extraordinarily low overpotential, for HER applications.

The disease affects 350-400 million people globally, with the highest rates in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Central Asia. The materials used are the virus's protein, HBsAg, to be studied and to create a vaccine to treat the disease. The research aims to create a vaccine against hepatitis B using in vitro methods and applications like NCBI, MSA, modeler v10.5 program, and Swiss-model web server. Material and Methods: The sequence is obtained using UniProt, and the phylogenetic tree is visualized using MEGA11. The NetSurfP web server predicts secondary structures, and InterPro Scan aligns primary sequences with the homologous structure. Modeller v10.5 is used to predict and create a 3D model for the vaccine. Protein sequences are obtained using NCBI, Discovery Studio software, and VLP-based vaccines to predict the B and MHC I T cell epitope. The allergenicity and antigenicity of vaccines are tested using AlgPred web servers and VaxiJen v2.0. Homology modeling results are obtained and analyzed using the Ramachandran plot.  Result: Salient points of this study dealing with the computational design of the Hepatitis B virus vaccine may be summarized as follows: different hepatitis B virus large envelope proteins were subjected to Multiple Sequence Alignment, and Phylogenetic Analysis identified the German sequence as the most recent strain. The secondary and tertiary structure of HBcAg core protein and HBsAg Germany HBV genotype D is predicted. Vaccine design was performed using a German HBsAg strain in BLAST, generating proteins from the selected sequences on Modeller v10.5 and refining the models through multiple templates. Predicted B and T cell epitopes from different web servers were combined into one peptide sequence of the designed vaccine. The allergenicity test using AlgPred forecasted the vaccine as a non-allergen, while VaxiJen demonstrated high antigenicity \nConclusion: The Swiss-model web server generated a model for the final vaccine sequence. The Ramachandran plot analysis showed 84.7% of residues in the favored region, indicating a sound structural model. This high percentage of residues in the favored region suggests that the predicted 3D structure of the vaccine candidate is likely to be stable and biologically plausible. The Ramachandran plot is a good guide to the quality of the protein structures: the more residues that fall into the favored regions, the more reliable and generally the refinement of the models.", "date": "2025-01-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

We found the limitations of in distinguishing homologous compounds may account for the suboptimal performance of binary fingerprints.  The principles of generation and collision of CMF was explored and an improved method based on Tanimoto distance was introduced to calculated molecular similarity represented by CMFs as well. Toxic substructures identified by Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method were substituted benzenes, long carbon chains, unsaturated carbons and halogen atoms. By incorporating KOW and monitoring shifts in feature importance, the influence of substructures on AFT was further delineated, revealing their roles in facilitating exposure and reactive toxicity. On this basis, we compared the toxicity of similar substructures and the same substructure in different chemical environments. To overcome the limitation of SHAP analysis, this study proposed a new method, toxicity index (TI), to identify substructures that were present in small quantities but highly toxic.

This process is particularly sensitive to temperature. Using machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) coupled with enhanced sampling techniques, we investigate the activation of methane under realistic operando conditions. Our analysis reveals that methane dissociation occurs predominantly at step-edge nickel atoms. As CHx (where x = 3 or 4) species bind to additional surface nickel atoms, their reduced mobility leads to entropic penalties that suppress certain configurations and transition states. This is reflected in the underlying free energy surfaces, where configurations such as methyl binding to hollow sites and activation routes involving two nickel atoms become unfavorable as temperature increases. At elevated temperatures, methane activation extends from step-edge sites to terrace regions because of reduced free-energy barriers and enhanced surface dynamics. By decomposing the free energy into enthalpic and entropic contributions, we uncover temperature-dependent shifts in the preferences of methane for the relevant active sites and arrive at a detailed molecular picture of methane activation.", "date": "2025-01-02", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Machine Learning; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For practical use, doping is required to overcome the kinetic limitations for diffusion and recombination on surfaces due to the required rehybridization of atoms. We studied the synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene on Ru(0001) by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of pyridine and N-doping through ion irradiation. Using the combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) we unambiguously identify the structure and location of the N species within the graphene moir\u00e9. The pyridine CVD leads only to a low concentration (<0.1 at%) of N-related sites. Higher concentrations of N-dopants (>10 at%) are subsequently introduced by low-energy ion irradiation.

DFT calculations provide detailed information about the relative thermodynamic stability of GN and PN within the graphene moir\u00e9. Measured and simulated STM images of GN and PN yield an excellent agreement, allowing us to confidently establish that GN is preferentially located near the center of the Atop region of the graphene moir\u00e9, while PN is located at the boundary between the FCC and HCP region, which are defined by the registry between C and Ru atoms.

Developing an accurate yet cost-effective solution would provide substantial benefits to both academia and industry. In this study, we propose three accuracy-based methods for predicting the theoretical coverage of generative models, classifying them into three cost levels: low, medium, and high.

To address sampling non-uniformity, we propose a novel double-parameter mathematical model that can accurately fit for both experimental and theoretical coverage across various generative architectures.

Transformer-based networks are helpful to generate new chemical compositions due to their self-attention mechanism, scalability, and ability to capture long-range dependencies. First, we developed a transformer-based network to generate new binary and ternary boride compositions based on the known boride compositions.

The photolysis of nitrate is a 'renoxification' process, which converts \\nitrate solvated in water or deposited on surfaces back into NOx to the atmosphere. Nitrate photolysis under environmental conditions can follow two channels: (1) NO2 and O-; (2) nitrite and O. Despite the well-studied macroscopic kinetics of the two channels, the microscopic picture of the photolysis still needs to be explored. Furthermore, previous experiments have shown that nitrate photolysis in aqueous solutions has a low quantum yield of ~1% leading to a solvation cage effect hypothesis. A previous theoretical study has indicated that the low quantum yield may be due to the direct spin-forbidden absorption of \\nitrate to its triplet state. Here, we employ first-principles molecular dynamics simulations at the level of hybrid DFT with enhanced sampling to explore the two channels in an aqueous solution to unravel the atomistic and electronic structure details of the photolysis, as well as investigate the causes of its low quantum yield under a solvation environment. The direct spin-forbidden absorption to T1 state is viable through spin-orbit coupling and is ~15 times weaker than the spin-allowed absorption to S1 state. A solvation cage complex is identified as a metastable state that requires additional thermal energy to complete the dissociation of the N-O bond at the triplet state. This metastable state allows the photo fragments to recombine or deactivate through non-radiative processes. Our simulations also qualitatively explain the temperature dependence of the two channels observed in experiments based on the rearrangement of H-bonds. This work provides a novel molecular picture illustrating the significantly low quantum yield and temperature dependence of nitrate photolysis under environmental conditions and a starting point for future studies of environmental nitrate photochemistry.

The coherence time of this molecule is limited by spin-phonon coupling driven decoherence processes, and one route to overcome this limitation is to increase the magnetic anisotropy of the metal included within the polyoxometalate (POM) complex. Herein we conducted a full investigation into the fundamental structural and vibrational properties of Lindqvist POMs that include uranium (IV), which also feature MJ = \u00b1 4 ground states, similar to Ho(III) in HoW10. Based on recent results from our group that demonstrated the importance of the secondary lattice elements in tuning the distortion of the D4d symmetry in W10 POM complexes, we synthesized eight UW10 complexes with different alkali metal counterions and evaluated how the composition and packing of counterion species affected complex structural and vibrational properties Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis on complexes 1-8 revealed changes in structural distortion parameters, i.e., skew angle, plane angle, and plane distance, as a function of differences in counterion configurations. Far-infrared and Raman spectra for 1-8 also demonstrated that vibrational mode frequencies [\u03bd(WO5)2, \u03c1(UO8), \u03bd/\u03c1(UO8), \u03b4/\u03c1(UO4), POM deformation mode, \u03b4(W-O-W/W=O/U-O-W), \u03bd(W-O-W), and \u03bd(U-O-W)] were sensitive to changes in counterion composition and packing. To more effectively compare different counterions configuration we developed counterion effective ionic radius (eIR) as a new structural parameter and comparisons between structural distortion parameters and counterion eIR strongly suggest modulation by the secondary lattice elements can affect structural and vibrational manifolds within POM complexes. Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis was used to quantitatively evaluate correlations observed within this investigation, and PLS statistical models showed strong correlation between counterion eIR and both structural distortion parameters and vibrational mode frequencies.

Insight into these interactions enables a holistic comprehension of bulk properties, and thus understanding them has direct implications for supramolecular design. However, even modest changes to intermolecular interactions can create unpredictable changes to solid-state structures and dynamics. For example, copper(II) acetylacetonate (Cu(C5}H7O2)2) and copper(II) hexafluoroacetylacetonate (Cu(C5HF6O2)2) exhibit similar molecular conformations, yet differences between the methyl and trifluoromethyl groups produce distinct sets of intermolecular forces in the condensed phase. Ultimately, these differences produce unique molecular arrangements in the solid state, with corresponding differences in material properties between the two crystals. In this work, terahertz spectroscopy is used to measure low-frequency vibrational dynamics, which, by extension, provide detailed insight into the underlying intermolecular forces that exist in each system. The experimental data is coupled to theoretical quantum mechanical simulations to precisely quantify the interplay between various energetic effects, and these results highlight the delicate balance that is struck between electronic and dispersive interactions that underpin the structural and related differences between the two systems.

Current methods rely on postoperative imaging, which challenges the mapping of the dynamic forces acting on the aortic root and annuloplasty ring during the cardiac cycle.

Improved carbon capture technologies that are driven by electrochemistry are under active development and it was recently found that supercapacitor energy storage devices can reversibly capture and release carbon dioxide. So-called supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) has several advantages over traditional carbon dioxide capture technologies such as lower energy consumption and the use of non-toxic materials. However, the mechanism for the capture of CO2 in these devices is poorly understood, making it challenging to design improved systems\u00ac. Here the mechanism of SSA is investigated via finite-element modelling with COMSOL of aqueous continuum transport equations, coupled to the CO2 to bicarbonate reaction. This simple computational model reproduces the key experimental observations and shows that charging leads to bicarbonate depletion (or accumulation) in the electrodes, driving CO2 capture (or release) at the gas-exposed electrode. This suggests that relevant aspects of the mechanism are captured without excluding other mechanisms that might be at play in parallel as well. At very low charging currents, both experiments and modelling reveal a decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide captured, suggesting the presence of competing processes at the two electrodes, and that SSA is an inherently kinetic phenomenon.

Based on the structural vulnerability and physical confinement of such membranes, it remains a great challenge to achieve atomically defined and single-terminated surfaces by the typical chemical treatments and to induce interfacial redox-reactions in these nanoscopic transition metal oxides. To address this, we use the sacrificial layer exfoliation route, involving an all-perovskite epitaxial layer structure to fabricate freestanding SrTiO3 membranes with high crystallinity and defined surface morphology. To study the interfacial redox-behavior of the singly TiO2-terminated, annealed membrane, we employ the formation of oxygen vacancies in SrTiO3, triggered by the low-pressure deposition of a thin LaAlO3 layer epitaxially grown on the transferred SrTiO3 layer. A mixed Ti3+/4+ valence state is indicative of the induced transfer of oxygen ions from the confined SrTiO3 membrane into the LaAlO3 overlayer, resulting in an oxygen vacancy concentration around 1021 cm\u22123 in the confined SrTiO3 membrane.

However, polymer chemistry, one of the most active branches of chemistry, has yet to establish a unified deep learning framework due to the complexity of polymer structures. Existing self-supervised learning methods for polymers simplify them into repeating units and neglect their inherent periodicity, thereby limiting the models\u2019 ability to generalize across various tasks. To address this challenge, we herein propose a periodicity-aware deep learning framework for polymers (named PerioGT). In pre-training, a chemical knowledge-driven periodicity prior is constructed and incorporated into the model through contrastive learning. Then, periodicity prompts are learned in fine-tuning based on the periodicity prior to better leveraging the knowledge acquired in pre-training. Additionally, a novel graph augmentation strategy is employed for polymers, which integrates additional conditions via virtual nodes to effectively model complex chemical interactions. PerioGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 12 downstream tasks. Moreover, wet-lab experiments in antimicrobial polymer discovery highlight PerioGT\u2019s potential in the real world, identifying two polymers with potent antimicrobial properties. All the results demonstrate that introducing the periodicity prior of polymers effectively improves the model performance.", "date": "2025-01-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Polymer Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, the trade-off between these diverse scintillation properties is an enormous challenge facing almost all scintillators. To overcome this limitation, in this work, we developed a strategy based on through-space heavy atom-\u03c0 interactions to improve the performance of organic scintillators by introducing alkyl bromides into hybridized local and charge transfer (HLCT) emitters. Specifically, the HLCT state's locally excited characters result in a short radiative lifetime (3.74 ns) and a narrow radioluminescence bandwidth (56 nm). The HLCT state's charge-transfer features yield a large Stokes shift (> 100 nm). Meanwhile, through-space bromine-\u03c0 interactions enhance the photoluminescence quantum yield to 100%. Notably, a high X-ray imaging resolution (> 40.0 lp mm\u22121) was achieved, making the highest spatial resolution for organic scintillators reported to date.

However, the relative performance of SMILES and BigSMILES in polymer ML tasks remains unexplored.\nIn this study, we systematically evaluate SMILES and BigSMILES across 12 polymer-related tasks, including property prediction and inverse design, utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and large language models (LLMs).  Our results show that BigSMILES enables faster training times due to its reduced token complexity, and achieves comparable or superior performance to SMILES in certain predictive tasks. Moreover, BigSMILES more accurately encodes chemical information and monomer connectivity for copolymers within LLM frameworks. This work serves as a starting point for a comprehensive evaluation of SMILES and BigSMILES in polymer ML applications, highlighting the potential of BigSMILES to streamline and accelerate polymer informatics workflows, particularly for complex systems like copolymers and polymer composites. Looking ahead, advancing polymer representations to integrate polymer chain structure, phase morphology, and processing parameters will be crucial for capturing the multifaceted relationships between polymer structure and properties, driving more accurate and efficient modeling.", "date": "2025-01-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Polymer Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

However, strong and gradual spectral modifications were observed with the increasing dye concentration.

However, even the most active Pt-based catalysts are constrained by high overpotentials and poor stability, which hinder their practical implementation. Despite extensive efforts to improve catalyst performance, progress has remained limited. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective strategy utilizing super-concentrated electrolytes to enhance EAOR performance. By increasing the KOH concentration from 1 M to near saturation, we achieve a nearly 150 mV reduction in onset potential for pristine Pt catalyst (0.43 V vs RHE), which is among the lowest ones reported for EAOR to date. Moreover, this is accompanied by a 6.5-fold increase in peak current density and a nearly 100-fold extension in stable operating time. These substantial enhancements are attributed to the unique solution structure of super-concentrated electrolytes, which markedly differs from that of dilute solutions. In these concentrated media, the hydrogen-bonding network is altered, leading to the formation of highly nucleophilic H\u2083O\u2082\u207b species. These species effectively lower the activation energy for NH\u2083 deprotonation, thereby reducing the onset potential of EAOR and significantly boosting current density. Additionally, H\u2083O\u2082\u207b species promote the conversion of EAOR intermediates, preventing their accumulation, and thus improving EAOR stability.

We find that three prerequisites are important for achieving a substantial magnetic field in a single-molecule junction.

Adsorption in porous sorbents offers a promising method to mitigate CO2 emissions by capturing and storage. The zinc-triazole-oxalate-based metal-organic framework CALF-20 demonstrates high CO2 capacity, low H2O affinity, and low CO2 adsorption heat, enhancing energy efficiency while maintaining stable performance over multiple adsorption/desorption cycles. This study examines CO2 adsorption in CALF-20. Using the combination of positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS), in situ-Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) analyses, and gas adsorption experiments, we elucidate the CO2 adsorption mechanisms in CALF-20 under various temperatures, and humidity levels, simulating ambient conditions. The variable temperature PALS experiments demonstrate that CO\u2082 molecules are spatially localized within the CALF-20 cages, leaving temperature- and pressure-dependent gaps between them. PALS results indicate that CO2 initially spreads across cage centers, 1D chains, and ultimately adheres to pore walls. Interestingly, positronium intensity, which increases with CO\u2082 adsorption pressure, closely aligns with the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm and reflects gas uptake behaviour. Moreover, we explore the adsorption characteristics of relative humidity (RH) and humid CO\u2082 in CALF-20. At low RH in pure humidity run, water molecules are sparsely adsorbed within the framework, forming isolated clusters or small oligomers with minimal hydrogen bonding. Above 35% RH, water molecules begin to form interconnected hydrogen-bond networks that fill the cages, significantly altering the material's free volumes. In humid CO\u2082 experiment, competitive interactions between CO\u2082 and water are observed, where CO\u2082 initially disrupts the propagation of water, but at higher RH, water molecules form more extensive hydrogen-bond networks. This competition influences both the cage and inter-granular spaces, with the latter becoming larger and more flexible as water fills the framework.

This strong Faraday rotation, which is amongst the highest value known for organic materials, originates from the so-called Faraday B term. Typically, B term Faraday responses are weak. We demonstrate large amplification through excitonic coupling within the supramolecular assembly, where the chirality of the system controls the assembly formed.

Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations offer a route to prediction of conformational ensembles and the time-dependent behaviour of sugars and glycosylated macromolecules. However, at the all-atom level of detail, MD simulations are often too computationally demanding to allow a systematic investigation of molecular interactions in systems of interest.

Since supported hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysts are generally activated in H2 as reducing gas at medium-high temperatures (350\u2013500 \u00b0C), we suspected that hydride formation could occur during such catalyst pretreatments. In this work, we investigated silicon oxyhydride (SiHxOy, SiHx for brevity) formation during the reduction pretreatment of a set of Ni/SiO2 catalyst materials using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). We observed two distinct vibrational bands located at ~ 2275 and ~ 2257 cm\u22121, which we assigned to SiH and SiH2 species, as supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Since these vibrational bands are absent after hydrogenation of pure silica, we propose that the formation of hydrides was caused by hydrogen spillover from Ni metal nanoparticles supported on silica. The decrease in the band areas with rising temperature was used in a van t \u2018Hoff plot to yield enthalpy values of ~ 26 and ~ 42 kJ/mol for the apparent reaction of hydride species, suggesting an equilibrium with IR-inactive or very mobile species. The reactivity of the SiHx species was also investigated, by dosing methanol, water and CO2 as probe molecules on the pre-reduced Ni/SiO2 catalysts. Methanol reacted the fastest with the hydride species, followed by water, while CO2 did not show any interaction with the hydrides.

Although oral and subcutaneous (SC) routes are preferred for their convenience and have the potential for better patient comfort and cost reduction, oral chemotherapy faces issues like poor bioavailability and adherence, while SC delivery is unsuitable for irritant or vesicant drugs due to local toxicity. To overcome these limitations, the polymer prodrug strategy has been explored, where drugs are linked to a polymer, reducing toxicity and enhancing drug delivery. Recent work has focused on creating water-soluble polymer prodrugs for SC delivery of paclitaxel (Ptx), a hydrophobic and vesicant drug, which was successfully conjugated to polyacrylamide (PAAm), a very hydrophilic biocompatible polymer, resulting in safer SC injection and enhanced therapeutic efficacy in tumor-bearing mice. However, this strategy's potential depends on adapting it to other vesicant anticancer drugs. Making the polymer degradable for facilitated excretion would also be a key improvement. In this work, this approach has been successfully extended to gemcitabine (Gem), a widely used but irritant anticancer drug, and to a degradable PAAm-based promoiety, having cleavable ester groups in the main chain. The resulting Gem-based prodrugs featured upper critical solution temperature to ensure complete solubility at the temperature of the SC tissue, sustained Gem release, significant degradation under physiological conditions, improved systemic toxicity and absence of local toxicity compared to free Gem. Remarkably, Gem-PAAm polymer prodrugs exhibited significant anticancer efficacy in mice bearing Mia Pa-Ca 2 tumors, outperforming Gemzar\u00ae, the commercial formulation of Gem.

Despite these advancements, the calculation of Hessian matrices for large systems remains challenging, in particular, because analytical second-order derivatives are often not implemented. This necessitates the use of computationally expensive finite-difference methods, which can furthermore display low precision in some cases. Automatic differentiation (AD) offers a promising alternative to reduce this computational effort and make the calculation of Hessian matrices more efficient and accurate. Here, we present the implementation of AD-based second-order derivatives for the popular MACE equivariant graph neural network architecture. The benefits of this method are showcased via a high-throughput prediction of heat capacities of porous materials with the MACE-MP-0 foundation model. This is essential for precisely describing gas adsorption in these systems and was previously only possible with bespoke ML models or expensive first-principles calculations. We find that the availability of foundation models and accurate analytical Hessian matrices offers comparable accuracy to bespoke ML models in a zero-shot manner, and additionally allows investigating finite size and rounding errors in the first-principles data.", "date": "2025-01-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we show that the use of enhanced sampling techniques, when combined with a judiciously chosen set of order parameters, offers an efficient and robust route for characterizing the thermodynamics of self-assembly and supramolecular transitions.

While the Ru (0001) surface is well-studied, hydrogen interaction with the Ru (101 \u03051) and Ru (101 \u03050) facets remains mostly underexplored. In this contribution, we use density functional theory calculations to investigate hydrogen adsorption and dissociation and provide insights into the adsorbed hydrogen role in catalytic polyolefin plastic hydrogenolysis. We start our investigation by exploring all the unique surface and subsurface sites for hydrogen adsorption and dissociation and identify hcp and higher hollow as the most favorable atomic hydrogens adsorption sites on the Ru (101 \u03051) and Ru (101 \u03050) surfaces, respectively. We find that atomic hydrogen can easily migrate on these surfaces to achieve the most stable arrangement at different coverages. We then combine these findings with ab-initio thermodynamics and microkinetic modeling to build surface phase diagrams, which show that both surfaces are fully hydrogenated under typical catalytic conditions. We then study how the presence of the full hydrogen coverage affects the adsorption and dehydrogenation of butane as a proxy for polyethylene, as these are the initial steps in the catalytic hydrogenolysis of polyolefin plastic waste. We find that the adsorption energy of butane decreases when the two surfaces are fully hydrogenated but adsorption remains favorable. We then investigate two possible mechanisms for the dehydrogenation step. The most favorable dehydrogenation mechanism involves the reaction of a surface hydrogen with an alkane hydrogen to produce H2 gas and an adsorbed alkyl radical. However, both mechanisms have positive reaction free energies suggesting that polyolefin dehydrogenation will be slow on these surfaces.", "date": "2025-01-08", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These equations reveal that, under supersaturation, the largest cluster size (LCS) is an important state-variable; the supersaturation degree decreases with the LCS, approaching unity in the macroscopic limit. We identify the critical supersaturation condition, above which the nuclei undergo the phase transition to form large crystals. Below this critical supersaturation, the nucleus size distribution is either a unimodal function or a monotonically decreasing function of size, depending on system and temperature. We also predict the most probable nucleus size and the direction of spontaneous changes of the LCS.

Mutations in ARSB, at least those characterized in detail, often destabilize and interfere with the folding of the ARSB protein, resulting in the loss of functional ARSB in lysosomes. Pharmacological chaperones, which are ligands that assist in protein folding by binding to folding intermediates in the endoplasmic reticulum, are proposed to be potential drug candidates for such protein misfolding diseases. However, small-molecule ligands for ARSB have not been widely studied and most of the known ligands are sulfate compounds, which are highly polar and do not readily cross the membrane. Since pharmacological chaperones must be able to enter the cell and the endoplasmic reticulum, a surrogate pharmacophore with membrane permeable properties is needed. In this study, we identified phenylboronic acid as an effective sulfate surrogate with membrane permeability, via competitive enzymatic assay against ARSB. Additionally, phenylboronic acids were more potent at neutral pH and less so at acidic pH, exhibiting a pH selective activity profile ideal for pharmacological chaperones. Subsequent structure-activity relationship studies identified more potent derivatives, and ARSB was protected from thermal denaturation in the presence of the derivatives, supporting direct binding of the phenylboronic acids. Although further studies will be required to determine if these phenylboronic acids could act as pharmacological chaperones for ARSB mutants, our finding of phenylboronic acid as a pH-selective surrogate pharmacophore for the aryl sulfate should be valuable for designing pharmacological chaperones for sulfatases in the future.", "date": "2025-01-09", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Nevertheless, chemical processes at semiconductor surfaces triggered by light excitation under applied potential remain poorly explored. This work deciphers the synergistic role of potential and light excitation on boron-doped diamond electrodes in producing either surface redox reactions or emission of solvated electrons in water. The role of diamond surface termination on electron affinity, band bending, and charge extraction is identified in a photoelectrochemical cell. While photocurrent is observed for excitation as low as 3.5 eV, we show that it is mostly induced by surface redox reactions, whereas solvated electrons are detected only for excitation above the bandgap (5.47 eV). Solvated electrons are generated irrespective of band bending, which only affects the emission yield. Depending on the surface band bending, photoreduction of the hydroxylated surface groups and photooxidation of the -H surface groups can be induced by direct photoexcitation in the range of 4.2-4.8 eV. The surface of the diamond can be electrochemically reduced when the Fermi level of the oxidized surface decreases below the H\u207a/H\u2082 redox potential. On the other hand, the hydrogenated surface oxidizes spontaneously for potentials at which the Fermi level drops below the occupied CH surface states, depending on both the pH and electron affinity of the surface.

The goal was to obtain a quantitative model for clustered P1 centers in diamonds generated under high pressure and high temperature (HPHT). The study relied on frequency-stepped measurements of DNP profiles under magic angle spinning (MAS) using the mm-wave output of a frequency-tunable gyrotron and a regular superconducting NMR magnet set at a single field.

This urgency has driven the increasing interest in integrating robotics and machine learning into materials research to accelerate experimental learning. However, idealized decision-making frameworks to achieve maximum sampling efficiency are not always compatible with high-throughput experimental workflows inside a laboratory. For multistep chemical processes, differences in hardware capacities can complicate the digital framework by introducing constraints on the maximum number of samples in each step of the experiment, hence causing varying batch sizes in variable selection within the same batch. Therefore, designing flexible sampling algorithms is necessary to accommodate the multi-step synthesis with practical sampling constraints unique to each high-throughput workflow. In this work, we designed and employed three strategies on a high-throughput robotic platform to optimize the sulfonation reaction of redox-active molecules used in flow batteries. Our strategies adapt to the multi-step experimental workflow, where their formulation and heating steps are separate, causing varying batch size requirements. By strategically sampling using clustering and mixed-variable batch Bayesian optimization, we were able to iteratively identify optimal conditions that maximize the yields.

However, the mechanisms of action of these inhibitors at the protein level and their relative impact on folding in bacterial versus human cells remained unknown.  In this study, cryoEM analyses identified a set of 7-fold symmetrical inhibitor binding sites at the GroEL ring-ring interface (RRI).  In addition, LC-MS/MS analyses identified two sets of binding sites at the apical domains and the ATP pockets.  These findings, coupled with results from biochemical assays evaluating a small panel of PBZ-based inhibitors, allowed the development of a unique mechanistic model that explains how PBZ binding at the three sites modulates the ATPase and client protein folding functions of E. coli GroEL/ES.  Screening of our diversity set of structurally distinct GroEL/ES inhibitors highlighted the unique mechanism of PBZ compounds binding to the RRI and disrupting the intra- and inter-ring allostery governing chaperonin function.  We further developed complementary intravital reporter assays to measure the targeting of GroEL/ES in S. aureus bacteria and HSP60/10 in the mitochondria of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells.  Compound screening using these assays support the differential engagement of PBZ analogs with chaperonins in bacteria and/or human cells.

To address these challenges, we develop an automated system to precisely control the solvent dropping and substrate heating processes. Spin coating is performed by using an automated system comprising a robot arm, spin coater, automatic solution dropping part, hot plate, and substrate storage area. Manual fabrication is conducted simultaneously to compare the outcomes. The reproducibility of devices fabricated by using the system and intra- and interbatch consistency are assessed. The automated system considerably diminishes performance fluctuations across batches conducted on different dates from 2.2 to 0.4%. Especially, the automated, uniform application of an antisolvent considerably minimize surface roughness variability in perovskite films. X-ray diffraction analyses further reveal differences between the residual PbI2 contents of perovskite films fabricated via automated and manual methods. Additionally, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements indicate that the residual PbI2 depth distribution in the perovskite layer was influenced by the antisolvent drop rate and timing. The results suggest that precise control of antisolvent drop rates and drop timings can improve the reproducibility of perovskite solar cells.", "date": "2025-01-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While the focus on thermal runaway typically centers on the exothermic reactions associated with the decomposition and interactions of electrode materials and electrolytes, the role of current collectors has been largely overlooked. This study demonstrates that the commonly considered stable aluminum (Al) current collector undergoes severe exothermic reactions with all lithiated cathode materials or air at temperatures exceeding 600 \u00b0C, due to the destruction of Al surface passivation film by fluorides. The heat released per unit mass of Al (-22 ~ -33 kJ/g) is nearly double that of the electrolyte (-12 ~ -16 kJ/g). Considering that the weight of Al current collector in batteries accounts for approximately half that of the electrolyte, the heat generated from Al oxidation during thermal runaway is comparable to that from electrolyte combustion. Furthermore, the fluoride-promoted high-energy Al reactions, resembling those observed in Al-based rocket propellants, are resistant to suppression by conventional flame retardants. This finding reveals a prevalent but previously overlooked high-energy reaction mechanism associated with Al current collectors, offering new insights into thermal runaway of uncharged batteries and presenting potential strategies for enhancing safety.

This work presents a strategy towards reducing the demand for fast test line associative kinetics via a \u2018capture-and-release\u2019 approach. Using a HER2 model antigen system, this methodology \u2013 termed the \u201cAmpliFold\u201d approach \u2013 involves the initial sequestration of analyte-bound complexes which undergo triggered release and are re-bound, using high-affinity hapten interactions, for enhanced signal-to-noise detection.

Cleavable Fab fragment conjugates were combined with \u2018dual-affinity\u2019 gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) highly decorated with fluorescein-tagged anti-HER2 antibodies to facilitate signal amplification. The utility of the AmpliFold approach is demonstrated by titrating capture receptor density to modulate signal distribution across test lines. Larger capture areas in the AmpliFold approach were shown to overcome poor capture kinetics associated with low receptor densities, achieving up to a 16-fold improvement in limit of detection. The AmpliFold approach was further shown to address the poor diffusivity and surface binding kinetics of large nanoparticles in sensitive LFA systems. Using high capture receptor densities and a 150 nm AuNP example, a 12-fold sensitivity enhancement was achieved when comparing AmpliFold to traditional LFAs for the detecting of antigen spiked into both buffer and human serum samples.

Coordination environments that promote high-spin ground states obviate the need for spin-state crossing and can promote rapid oxidation reactivity.

For instance, the Solvent-Targeted Recovery and Precipitation STRAP (TM) process uses sequential solvent washes to selectively dissolve and separate constituent polymers from multicomponent plastic waste, including films. STRAP (TM) process design (separation sequence, type of solvents, and operating conditions) changes significantly depending on the design of the multilayer plastic film (e.g., number, types, and proportions of polymers). The ability to quickly quantify the economic and environmental benefits of diverse STRAP (TM) process designs is essential to accelerate the development of sustainable recycling processes and more recyclable multilayer film products. In this work, we present a fast computational framework that integrates molecular-scale models, process modeling, and techno-economic and life cycle analysis to quickly evaluate STRAP (TM) designs. The computational framework is general and can be used to study the processing of complex multilayer plastic waste streams that contain many layers. We highlight the different uses of the framework via targeted case studies.

In this study, we present a computational framework for designing PdIV-based catalysts for nondirected meta-selective C-H activation of anisole, with a focus on ligand design for the Pd complex. Among the ligands surveyed, the pyrazolo naphthyridine (PzNPy) ligand was predicted to exhibit both higher reactivity and selectivity for meta-C-H activation compared to other ligands, as evidenced by its lower overall and relative (meta vs. para) Gibbs free energy barriers, respectively. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) highlighted the importance of noncovalent interactions, particularly the frozen interaction components (permanent electrostatics, Pauli repulsion, and dispersion), in determining the selectivity trends. Systematic modification of the PzNPy ligand in silico by introducing various electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents revealed that while changes to substituents do not significantly affect the selectivity of the catalyst, they do have a pronounced effect on its reactivity. Furthermore, we observed a strong correlation between the Hammett sigma meta (\u03c3m) constant of the substituents and the enthalpic contributions to the free energy barrier (\u2206H\u2021meta), highlighting how the electronic effects of substituents influence reactivity. Further analysis also revealed a strong correlation between \u2206H\u2021meta and the strength of electrostatic interaction evaluated at the intermediate reactant complex that forms prior to the transition state, providing insights into the enhanced reactivity associated with electron-withdrawing substituents on the PzNPy ligand.

However, identifying optimal CVs that align with the slow modes of complex molecular systems with many coupled degrees of freedom can be a significant challenge. Deep time-lagged independent component analysis (Deep-TICA) addresses this issue by employing an artificial neural network that generates non-linear combinations of molecular descriptors to learn the slowest degrees of freedom. Training Deep-TICA CVs, however, typically requires long equilibrium simulations that can sample multiple recrossing events across various metastable conformations of the molecule. This requirement can often be prohibitively expensive, thereby limiting its widespread application. In this study, we present an algorithm that enables the training of Deep-TICA CVs using a limited amount of trajectory data obtained from short non-equilibrium metadynamics simulations that only sample one forward transition from the initial to the final state. We achieve this by utilizing the variational Koopman algorithm, which reweights short off-equilibrium trajectories to reflect the equilibrium probability densities. We demonstrate that enhanced sampling simulations conducted along the Koopman reweighted Deep-TICA CV can accurately and efficiently converge the free energy surface for systems such as the Muller-Brown Potential, Alanine Dipeptide, and the chignolin mini-protein. Our approach, therefore, addresses the key challenge of inferring slow modes from limited trajectory data, making it more feasible to use deep learning CVs to study molecular processes of practical relevance.", "date": "2025-01-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Statistical Mechanics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Leonardo", "abstract": "An invisible, reversible, previously overlooked catalytic reaction \u2014 enolization \u2014 occurs consistently when carboxylic acid vapors contact metal oxide surfaces. A relatively strong acidity of the CO2H group in carboxylic acids is responsible for the formation of the conjugate base, carboxylate, adsorbed on Lewis acid centers of metal oxide surfaces. Acidity of the alpha C-H group is much weaker and hidden from direct observations during carboxylic acids interaction with metal oxide surfaces, but it is detectable through hydrogen \u2013 deuterium isotopic exchange. Subsequent condensation of the enolized carboxylate with another surface carboxylate comes into play in the mechanism of ketones formation with decarboxylation, an important part of oxygen removal during upgrading of biofuels. In this kinetic study, the rate of approaching equilibrium was measured for H/D isotopic exchange on alpha-carbon of isobutyric acid used in various concentrations in a vapor phase mixture with D2O as well as for the reversed H/D exchange between alpha-deuterated isobutyric acid and H2O upon contact with monoclinic zirconia and anatase titania catalysts. Faster rate for H/D vs. D/H exchange points to alpha-deprotonation, i.e., enolization, as the rate determining step of the exchange mechanism. The intrinsic rate of the enolization was deduced using McKay equation for equilibrium reactions. The kinetic activation parameters were obtained through the temperature dependence of the rate constant for both exchange directions, H/D and D/H. KOH doping on ZrO2 changes the geometry of the transition state leading to higher rates of enolization and increasing H/D kinetic isotope effect from 1.4 to 8.3. The opposite effect of KOH doping is observed on anatase TiO2 \u2013 enolization rates are slightly decreased, the kH/kD remains relatively constant at 2.7-2.8 indicating that the nature of basic centers on TiO2 is unaffected.

The size of these macromolecules and their various conformations demand computational inexpensive force fields that can accurately mimic the quantum chemical nature of the atomic non-covalent interactions. Accurate force fields, coupled with increasingly longer molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, may empower us to predict conformational changes associated with the biochemical function of proteins. Here, we aim to derive nonbonded protein force field parameters from the partitioned electron density of amino acids - the fundamental units of proteins - via the atoms-in-molecules (AIM) approach. The AIM parameters are validated using a database of charged, aromatic and hyrdrophilic side chain interactions in 610 conformations, primarily involving pi-pi interactions, as recently reported by one of us. Electrostatic and van der Waals interaction energies calculated with nonbonded force field parameters from different AIM methodologies were compared to first principle interaction energies from absolute localized molecular orbital - energy decomposition analysis (ALMO-EDA) at the wB97XV/def2TZVPD level. Our findings show that electrostatic interactions between side chains are accurately reproduced by atomic charges from the minimal basis iterative stockholder (MBIS) scheme with mean absolute errors of 4-7 kJ/mol. Meanwhile, C6 coefficients from the MBIS AIM method effectively predicts dispersion interactions with a mean error of -2 kJ/mol and a maximal error or -5 kJ/mol. As an outlook to use AIM methods in the development of protein force fields we present the constrained AIM method that allows to fix backbone parameters during the optimization of side chain interactions. Backbone dihedral parameters have been optimized to reproduce secondary structure elements in proteins and not altering them maintains compatibility with conventional protein force fields while improving the description of side chain interactions.

Here, we use quantum chemistry DFT methods and demonstrate a computationally cheap method for screening potential precursors for synthesizing porous metallosilicates. We estimate the thermodynamic parameters of condensation reactions of the octakis(trimethyltin)spherosilicate Si8O20(SnMe3)8 (CUBE) building block with metal chlorides and alkyl metals. These reactions represent the initial steps in the non-hydrolytic synthesis of metallosilicate gels containing potentially uniform single-site metal centers. Our main emphasis was on the spontaneity and irreversibility of the condensation and the computational screening of potential metal center sources. The precursors previously reported in successful condensations with CUBE, such as AlCl3, [AlCl4]\u2013, Si\u2013Cl compounds, PCl3, TiCl4, and VOCl3, are shown to undergo sufficiently irreversible reactions, as are the untested precursors BCl3, VCl4, and POCl3. Interestingly, AlMe3 proves to be twice as exoergic as AlCl3. The first chloride in Cp2TiCl2 reacts readily, but the second may be partially reversible. SbCl3 and Ph3SbCl2 are borderline cases and reversibility of their condensations might pose a problem. SnCl4 was found unsuitable as a precursor to stannosilicates. It should be possible to prepare zincosilicates from ZnEt2, but not from ZnCl2 as the affinity of Zn for Cl\u2013 is so high that in the presence of a source of Cl\u2013, zincosilicate structures will dissolve back to CUBE and ZnCl2. The oxophilicity of the metal in the precursor is the main factor in the driving force for the condensation with CUBE. Alkyl metals and lighter elements are more prone to the reaction than the corresponding metal chlorides and heavier analogs. The propensity of [SnMe3]+ to bind to Cl\u2013 in preference to CUBE has a supporting effect. At low temperatures, the condensation is slightly disfavored, while at the experimentally used temperature of 100 \u00b0C, this process contributes over 20 kJ mol\u20131 of the additional driving force and helps to complete the condensation.

Using force-field-based molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the $\\alpha$-alumina (0001) surface exhibits an affinity of 4 kBT for individual glycine or GG dipeptide molecules, due to hydrogen bonds formed at both the C- and N-termini. In simulations with multiple glycine molecules, surface-bound glycine enhances further adsorption, leading to the formation of long chains connected by hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl and amine groups of glycine molecules. The probability of forming long amino acid chains is examined using metadynamics enhanced sampling and a modified Flory theory. We find that the likelihood of observing chains longer than 10 glycine units increases by at least 5 orders of magnitude at the surface compared to the bulk. This surface-driven assembly is primarily due to local high density and alignment with the alumina surface pattern, resulting in a competition between enthalpy and entropy effects on adsorption. The formation of these chains necessitates the removal of coordinated water molecules. Importantly, our findings reveal that when dipeptides are present, only the N-terminus forms hydrogen bonds with the surface, suggesting that the surface may disfavor the backward hydrolysis of newly formed peptides.

At the atomistic scale, the thermodynamic instability of many solid state electrolyte materials can explain their susceptibility to crystal decomposition upon contact with the lithium anode.

Colobognatha are the only millipedes that produce terpenoid alkaloids, and prior to 2020, studies into these defensive secretions were limited to a single order, Polyzoniida. However, it has become clear that numerous species of the order Platydesmida also produce structurally diverse terpenoid alkaloids with potent biological activity. Platydesmida defensive secretions encompass multiple natural product scaffolds with greater chemical complexity compared to previously reported millipede-derived alkaloids. Here we report the analysis of the defensive secretions of Andrognathus corticarius, a millipede found across the Appalachian region. A. corticarius is evolutionary sister to all other Platydesmida and is the presumed oldest genus within the order. Analysis of the defensive secretions revealed that A. corticarius produces an arsenal of alkaloids that are dissimilar to all previously reported metabolites. Complete structural elucidation was accomplished using 2D NMR, HRMS, chemical derivatization, DFT and ECD, which revealed the presence of two distinct scaffolds: a 5,6-fused heterocycle named the andrognathines and a 6,6,6,5-bridged heterocycle containing seven continuous stereogenic centers named the andrognathanols. Each scaffold is decorated with diverse fatty acids, which leads to the extraordinary number of unique metabolites detected within the secretions. The alkaloids likely serve to defend the millipedes from predation as they are actively secreted upon physical disturbance.

Using a library of N-pyridinium aziridine-based fragments combined with chemoproteomics-enabled target deconvolution, we identified lead hits for aspartates and glutamates in proteins such as mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (MTCH2), RUN and FYVE domain-containing protein 1 (RUFY1), and delta(24)-sterol reductase (DHCR24). Modular build-and-couple synthetic logic enabled fragment evolution via Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling to access N-aryl aziridines with enhanced affinities for MTCH2 and RUFY1. Notably, N-aryl aziridine 5b selectively modified RUFY1 at E502, disrupting its interactions within the endosomal trafficking network and impairing receptor recycling.

We recently showed the reversible aggregation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) via a small, cationic di-arginine peptide; however, the mechanism underlying this aggregation is not yet comprehensively understood. Here, we seek insights into the intermolecular interactions of cationic peptide-induced assembly of citrate-capped AuNPs by empirically measuring how peptide identity impacts AuNP aggregation. We examined the nanoscale interactions between the peptides and the AuNPs via UV-vis spectroscopy to determine the structure-function relationship of peptide length and charge on AuNP aggregation. Careful tuning of the sequence of the di-arginine peptide demonstrated that the mechanism of assembly is driven by a reduction in electrostatic repulsion. We show that an acetylated N-terminal and a carboxylic acid C-terminal decrease the peptide effectiveness in inducing AuNP aggregation. The increase in peptide size through addition of glycine or proline units hinders aggregation and leads to less redshift. Arginine-based peptides were also found to be more effective in assembling the AuNPs than cysteine-based peptides of equivalent length. We also illustrate that aggregation is independent of peptide stereochemistry. Finally, we demonstrate the modulation of peptide-AuNP behavior through changes to the pH, salt concentration, and temperature.

Recently, the quantitative Read-Across Structure-Activity Relationship (q-RASAR) modeling has been reported to enhance the external predictivity of QSAR models. However, in some studies, the cross-validation metrics of the q-RASAR models show compromised values compared to the corresponding QSAR models. In this background, we have reported here an improved q-RASAR workflow coupled with the Arithmetic Residuals in K-groups Analysis (ARKA) framework. This improved workflow (ARKA-RASAR) considers two important aspects \u2013 the contribution of different QSAR descriptors to different experimental response ranges, and the identification of the similarity among close congeners based on both the selected QSAR descriptors and the contribution of different QSAR descriptors to different experimental response ranges.  In this study, five different toxicity datasets that had been previously used for the development of QSAR and q-RASAR models were considered. We have developed hybrid ARKA models (consisting of a combination of QSAR descriptors and ARKA descriptors). These hybrid feature spaces were used to compute RASAR descriptors and develop ARKA-RASAR models. We have used the same modeling strategies (Partial Least Squares and Multiple Linear Regression) used to develop the previously reported QSAR and q-RASAR models for a fair comparison. In addition, these modeling algorithms are simple, reproducible, and transferable. The multi-criteria decision-making statistical approach, the Sum of Ranking Differences (SRD), inferred that the ARKA-RASAR models are the best-performing models, considering training, test, and cross-validation statistics. Two-way ANOVA was performed to show that the SRD values for the models from selected datasets and the four different modeling algorithms are significantly different. The least significant difference procedure ensures that the SRD values were significantly different for most models, presenting an unbiased workflow.

A comparative study of hydrogen and methyl-terminated SiNPs reveals that replacing hydrogen atoms with methyl groups results in a reduction of the fundamental gap, optical gap, and exciton binding energy. The effect of replacing hydrogen by methyl diminishes with increasing size of the silicon core of the particles, which can be attributed to the decreasing surface-to-volume ratio. Larger hydrogen-terminated SiNPs, therefore, serve as increasingly accurate models for alkyl-terminated SiNPs. The size of the lowest energy excited-state, exciton, increases when replacing (more of the) hydrogen atoms with methyl groups for a given silicon core size, suggesting that the exciton delocalises onto the methyl groups. Analysis of the relevant natural transition orbitals confirms that both the excited electron and hole components of the exciton partially delocalise on to the methyl groups, with increased delocalisation in the case of the excited electron.

We assume steady-state, axisymmetric, and laminar flow with non-slip boundary conditions along the network walls. We investigate two different roughness models (1) a self-similar roughness length scale aligned with the branching network pattern, and (2) a uniform roughness length scale and compare the results. We find that in case of the self-similar roughness model, the effective conductance remains the same as that of the smooth channels forming the network. However, in case of the uniform roughness model, the effective conductance presents an overall decrease. We argue that the uniform roughness model is a more realistic one. Further, the optimal effective conductance and the critical geometrical scaling parameter, such as diameter ratio, are analyzed as functions of network geometry and fluid rheology with power-law index. Under both volume and surface area constraint, increasing geometrical parameters such as daughter branches and network generations generally reduced optimal effective conductance, especially for shear-thickening fluids, while shear-thinning fluids were less affected. In macroscopic networks where roughness is relatively small, its effect on the optimal effective conductance is negligible; however, in microscopic networks, where roughness approaches the scale of the smallest channels, it leads to pronounced conductance reduction. Further constrained surface area shows significantly lower optimal effective conductance values compared to volume-constrained systems. Furthermore, we find that uniform surface roughness model predicts the scaling laws for optimal flow varying with all geometrical and rheology parameters. Moreover, in the case of self-similar roughness, the scaling laws for optimal flows are the same as those for the smooth network. These are the function of the branch-spitting number N, for volume constraint, and for both N and n, for surface area constraint. For macroscopic networks under the uniform roughness assumption, an approximation for the critical geometrical scaling parameter was derived using linearization with respect to the roughness intensity parameter, and it was found in good agreement with the full model equations.", "date": "2025-01-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Fluid Mechanics; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

Thus, strategies to lower \u03b7 while increasing TOF are needed for more energy-efficient NO3RR. In this study, we investigate the molecular electrocatalyst [CoIII(DIM)Br2]ClO4 (DIM = 2,3-dimethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradeca-1,3-diene), which selectivity catalyzes NO3RR to NH3.

This study investigates the influence of varying degrees of deuteration on the photophysical properties of TPE across different aggregation states. Through the synthesis of partially and fully deuterated TPE derivatives (TPE-5d, TPE-10d, TPE-20d), combined with steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, time-resolved fluorescence measurements, transient absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the dual role of deuteration in modulating non-radiative decay pathways. In loosely packed nanoaggregates, increased deuteration enhances photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and extends fluorescence lifetimes by reducing internal conversion rates. Conversely, in tightly packed crystalline states, deuteration leads to decreased PLQY and shortened lifetimes, attributable to the Duschinsky rotation effect (DRE), which enhances inter-mode coupling and internal conversion. Additionally, deuteration significantly prolongs the operational lifetime of blue organic light-emitting diode (OLED) devices, decuplicating the device lifespan in deuterated TPE-20d compared to non-deuterated TPE.

In this paper, we review the concept of thermodynamic length, and how it can be used as a principle to choose alchemical paths in free energy simulations.

Thus, one of the core challenges in aqueous electrolyte design is optimizing the formula to prevent freezing while maintaining good ion conductivity. However, the experimental trial-and-error approach is inefficient for this purpose, and existing simulation tools are either inaccurate or too expensive for high-throughput phase transition predictions. In this work, we employ a small amount of experimental data and differentiable simulation techniques to develop a multimodal optimization workflow. With minimal human intervention, this workflow significantly enhances the prediction power of classical force fields for electrical conductivity. Most importantly, simulated electrical conductivity can serve as an effective predictor of electrolyte freezing at low temperatures.

Solvent-based technologies are a promising alternative for recycling ML films because they enable recovery of constituent polymer resins. For example, the Solvent Targeted Recovery and Precipitation (STRAP) process sequentially dissolves and separates polymer components using a series of targeted solvent washes. A crucial design aspect of this process is the impact of selected solvents on human health and on the environment. This work introduces a computational framework that integrates molecular modeling, process modeling, techno-economic analysis (TEA), and life-cycle analysis (LCA) for quickly screen green solvents for solvent-based ML recycling processes. Initial screening for solvents based on selectivity is performed by estimating temperature-dependent solubilities using molecular-scale models. Subsequent screening uses basic estimates of energy use and octanol-water partition coefficients (logP) as key measures of health, safety, and environmental hazards. Detailed process modeling, TEA, and LCA are used on a reduced set of promising solvents identified in early screening steps to more accurately determine how solvent selection and associated operating conditions impact overall economics and environmental impacts. The framework is used for the identification of green solvents (from a database of 1,000 solvents) that separate an industrial ML film composed of polyethylene (PE), ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Our analysis shows the effectiveness of the framework and reveals fundamental trade-offs between solvent greenness, solubility, and economics.

Computational and experimental studies are combined to gain insight into the intrinsic mechanism for the ECL improvements with Ag-doping. The results demonstrated that Ag doping strategically induces ground-state structural distortion in CuAgNCsAssy. This distortion enhances the polarity of metal sites, facilitating the key process of coreactant (triethylamine) radical absorption and accelerating electron transfer. Furthermore, Ag doping suppresses excited-state structural relaxation, leading to boosted radiative emission, which also promotes efficient energy transfer processes and extends radiative lifetime.

The crystal structure of calcium carbonate has three polymorphs: the most thermodynamically stable calcite, followed by aragonite, vaterite, and amorphous \\ce{CaCO3} (ACC). Of the three crystalline phases, the most unstable vaterite remains mysterious regarding its formation process and structure.  In this study, the pathway of forming the vaterite crystal structure from ACC was reproduced using well-tempered metadynamics molecular dynamics simulations. The structures sampled at multiple minima on the energy landscape were refined through first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The sampled structures were assigned space groups (SGs) and classified as calcite- and vaterite-like structures according to the arrangement of \\ce{CO3^{2-}} and \\ce{Ca^{2+}} sheets. The initial crystal structure produced from ACC was a monoclinic crystal with \\ce{Ca^{2+}} sheets and \\ce{CO3^{2-}} lying in the interlayer; however, it did not exhibit the three-fold symmetry of calcite. Calcite structures with three-fold symmetry, or orthorhombic crystals with rotated \\ce{CO3^{2-}} units as found in vaterite, could be derived from this structure. The orthorhombic structure then transitioned to the more stable monoclinic form, which is likely vaterite.

For the latter, operation in solid state and different means to read/write/erase the information must be possible. These features, however, are challenging to achieve due to close molecular packing and intermolecular interactions. Here, we present acylhydrazones that photoswitch even in the solid state and adopt an open-shell triplet ground state electronic configuration in the photoswitched-form which is very long-lived. The optically stored information can thus be read magnetically and completely erased by applied electrochemical potential.

While experimental studies have revealed the importance of surface oxidation, a unified computational framework capable of simultaneously capturing both the thermodynamic aspects of rate-determining steps and the kinetic effects of site-blocking on the overpotential has remained elusive. In this work, we present a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by combining grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations with the MACE-MP-0 foundation model to study the ORR on experimentally reconstructed Pt nanoparticles. This framework enables the systematic investigation of oxidation effects across multiple scales, from atomic-level place-exchange mechanisms to macroscopic kinetic behavior. Our simulations reveal a strong dependence of system thermodynamics on oxygen coverage and successfully predict the place-exchange mechanism onset at 1.06 V vs. SHE, in agreement with experimental observations. Through established scaling relations and deletion energy analysis, we quantify both the rate-determining step and the distribution of reactive sites on the oxidized surface, providing insight into the complex interplay between surface oxidation and ORR activity. By linking our results with both theoretical and experimental benchmarks on multiple points, we ensure the viability of our assumptions and approach. Using a simplified kinetic model derived from our simulations, we demonstrate agreement with core experimental observations, validating the predictive power of foundation models in computational electrochemistry. This work not only provides a comprehensive understanding of oxide effects in ORR but also establishes a versatile computational methodology that can be readily extended to study similar electrochemical processes on other catalytic systems, offering a powerful new tool for rational catalyst design.", "date": "2025-01-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Machine Learning; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Furthermore, lithium metal titration-assisted differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (Li-DEMS) technique was developed to systematically investigate the charge-discharge behavior of three electrodes with different redox potentials (Li4Ti5O12, V2O5, and Zn) in nonaqueous/aqueous hybrid electrolytes containing different organic modulators and salts. The contributions of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation to irreversible capacity were decoupled. For all the electrodes studied, a higher IA-D value correlates with a smaller contribution of HER to irreversible capacities and higher initial and average Coulombic efficiencies. Notably, HER becomes the dominant contributor to irreversible capacity after the initial cycles. For the high-potential electrode (V2O5), electrochemical performance is primarily influenced by IA-D, rather than SEI formation, while for the low-potential electrode (Li4Ti5O12), both IA-D and SEI formation play significant roles in determining performance.

Towards a detailed understanding of NCI quantum mechanical (QM) methods allow for accurate estimates of interaction energies and geometries, allowing for the contributions of different types of NCI to condensed phase properties to be understood.

However, to date the relative orientation of monomers defining molecular interactions of dimers are often based on full geometry optimizations of all degrees of freedom or extracted from known experimental structures of biological molecules. In such cases the spatial relationship of the monomers often lead to multiple atoms in each monomer making significant contributions to the interactions occurring in the dimer confounding understanding of the contributions of specific atoms or functional groups. To overcome this a workflow is presented that allows for systematic control of the interaction orientation between monomers to be performed through the use of molecular interaction rules (MIR) in an extendable tool that can be applied to a broad range of chemical space. Using the \u201cMIR workflow\u201d allows a user to perform automation of the determination of well-defined monomer interaction orientations in dimers using Z-matrices allowing for potential energy scans (PES) to be performed on combinatorial pairs of the monomers.

How high the temperature of the matrix that surrounds the plasmonic NPs, such as the catalyst and substrate, can be reached is unclear. Herein, we study the dissipation of plasmonic heat generated by resonantly excited gold (Au) NPs dispersed on P25 TiO2 NP porous film in air. Under resonant 532 nm continuous wave (CW) laser irradiation at the surface of the Au-TiO2, the surface evaporation and the aggregation of Au NPs were observed at moderate laser power (10 mW/\u00b5m2). This process is accompanied by the phase transition of TiO2. More importantly, the TiO2 nanoparticle film melted, forming melt pools and molten TiO2 matrix. This indicates that the temperature of the TiO2 reached as high as its melting point of 1830 \u00b0C. When Au/TiO2 was irradiated with an off-resonance laser at 638 nm, no phase transformation or melting of TiO2 was observed. The temperature calculation showed that the heating generated by Au NPs is not localized. The collective heating from an ensemble of Au NPs in the irradiated area produced a global temperature rise that melted TiO2.

Here, we demonstrate the clean and efficient modification of polyethylene (PE) through the solvent- and catalyst-free photochemical oximation, using t-butyl nitrite (t-BuONO) as inexpensive and easy to handle NO radical source. The photochemical oximation uses LED long wave ultraviolet light and is run neat under aerobic conditions. The photochemical reaction conditions were optimised using linear small- to large-chain alkanes as model substrates. Using four different types of polyethylene (self synthesised low-molecular weight, commercially available low molecular weight and high molecular weight as well as post consumer material), we successfully incorporated oxime, ketone and nitro functional groups on the polymer backbone, without radical cleavage or crosslinking. The functionalisation degree of the three different functional groups is tuneable depending on the reaction atmosphere and system pressure, and the total functionalisation degree on the backbone can reach up to 2.9%. Detailed analysis, including 2D NMR spectroscopy with 15N-isotopically labelled modified PE produced with t-BuO15NO, provided insight into functional group distribution and regiochemistry, revealing that the photochemical oximation preferentially functionalises the pre-terminal carbon position and that the functional groups are randomly spaced apart on the polymer backbone rather than positioned adjacent to each other. Additionally, reactivity studies together with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy showed that the oxime is converted to the ketone via an iminoxyl radical species, confirming that it solely arises from the further reactivity of the oxime functional group via an iminoxyl radical pathway. These results demonstrate tuneable functionalisation, enabling the production of modified polyolefins with tailored properties that potentially broaden their application range and provide opportunities for improved recyclability.", "date": "2025-01-16", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Polymer Science; Organic Polymers", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Hence, there is a need for the development of inexpensive membranes for Li-salt electrodialysis applications with a lower content of environmentally hazardous fluorinated compounds.

However, while the cysteine coverage of chemoproteomic studies has increased substantially, these methods still only provide a partial assessment of proteome-wide cysteine reactivity, with cysteines from low abundance proteins and tough-to-detect peptides still largely refractory to chemoproteomic analysis. Here we integrate cysteine chemoproteomic reactivity datasets with structure-guided computational analysis to delineate key structural features of proteins that favor elevated cysteine reactivity towards IAA. We first generated and aggregated multiple descriptors of cysteine microenvironment, including amino acid content, solvent accessibility, residue proximity, secondary structure, and predicted pKa. We find that no single feature is sufficient to accurately predict reactivity. Therefore, we developed the CIAA (Cysteine reactivity towards IodoAcetamide Alkyne) method, which utilizes a Random Forest model to assess cysteine reactivity by incorporating descriptors that characterize the 3D structural properties of thiol microenvironments. We trained the CIAA model on existing and newly generated cysteine chemoproteomic reactivity data paired with high-resolution crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), with cross validation against an external dataset.

For LR-CCSD and EOM-CCSD, we find that f_comp,S generally gives a better agreement with experimental strengths than f_comp. For LR-CCSD in the length gauge, for instance, there is a 1 to 1 scaling of the (nf_exp, f_comp,S) pairs. Instead, the results for TD-DFT depend on the amount of HF exchange used in the functional: pure functionals typically also have a 1 to 1 scaling of the (nf_exp, f_comp,S) pairs, while for hybrid functionals f_comp,S overestimates nf_exp to a degree that appears proportional to the amount of HF exchange present in the functional.", "date": "2025-01-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Rogers; P\u00e9ter R. Nagy; Alexandre Tkatchenko", "abstract": "Predicting the binding affinity of ligand molecules to protein pockets is a key step in the drug design pipeline. The flexibility of ligand-pocket motifs arises from a wide range of attractive and repulsive electronic interactions invoked upon binding. Accurately accounting for all these interactions on equal footing requires robust quantum-mechanical (QM) benchmarks, which are scarce for ligand-pocket systems. In addition, the puzzling disagreement between ``gold standard'' Coupled Cluster (CCSD(T)) and Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods [Nat. Commun. 12, 3927 (2021)]  casts doubt on many existing benchmarks for larger non-covalent systems. Here, we introduce the ``Quantum Interacting Dimer'' (QUID) benchmark framework containing 170 non-covalent systems spanning equilibrium and non-equilibrium geometries that model chemically and structurally diverse ligand-pocket motifs. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory shows that QUID broadly covers non-covalent binding motifs and energetic (exchange-repulsion, electrostatic, induction, and dispersion) contributions. Robust and reproducible binding energies are obtained using two complementary QM methods: LNO-CCSD(T) and QMC, achieving mutual agreement of 0.3 kcal/mol. Analysis of this benchmark data reveals that several dispersion-inclusive density functional approximations provide accurate energy predictions, though they exhibit discrepancies in magnitude and orientation of atomic van der Waals forces, which could influence the dynamics of ligands within the pocket. On the contrary, semiempirical methods and widely used empirical force fields require improvements, particularly in capturing non-covalent interactions (NCIs) for out-of-equilibrium geometries. The wide span of molecular dipole moments and polarizabilities in QUID also demonstrates flexibility in designing pocket structures to achieve desired binding properties. Therefore, QUID sets a new ``platinum standard'' for reliable and reproducible QM benchmarks of NCIs in larger systems and enhances our understanding of biomolecular ligand-pocket interactions.", "date": "2025-01-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Physical and Chemical Properties", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

The latter modification reduces the formal complexity to O(N^3) with system size.   In conjunction with a many-body dispersion model (XSAPT+MBD) or empirical dispersion potentials fitted to ab initio data (XSAPT+aiD), the hybrid procedure achieves sub-kcal/mol accuracy with respect to high-level benchmarks. XSAPT is equipped with an energy decomposition that partitions the intermolecular interaction energy into components that include electrostatics, Pauli repulsion, dispersion, and induction, the latter of which can be further separated into polarization and charge transfer.  As compared to energy decomposition analyses used in density functional theory, separation of the dispersion energy in XSAPT is less ambiguous and the energy partition agrees well with accurate third-order SAPT benchmarks.

The synthesis of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs)  has been extensively explored in the literature; however, preparative routes that allow for precise particle size and shape tunability with the scope for surface functionalization and industrial scalability remain challenging. Secondly, taking into account the importance of green chemistry in nanomaterial synthesis, a synthetic protocol that limits the use of harmful chemicals is highly solicited. In this work, we outline a simple one-pot decomposition route that avoids the complexities involved in the preparation, separation, and purification of precursor complexes required of traditional preparative routes and, consequently, is easily scalable. Ricinoleic acid was employed as a greener alternative to oleic acid as both the metal complexing and the capping agent. The modified thermal decomposition route effectively bypasses the demanding precursor synthesis steps of the traditional thermal decomposition route while retaining its advantages. Minor modifications in the preparation scheme allow for the control of particle size and shape. Additionally, a simple and general NTA-mediated ligand-exchange protocol was outlined that can directly transfer the hydrophobic nanoparticles from the non-aqueous reaction mixture to an aqueous phase without the need for product separation from the crude reaction mixture.

When p53 is non-functional in cells that may also be undergoing uncontrolled cell growth (due to other mutations), cancer readily emerges. Consequently, restoring the function of misregulated and mutated Tp53 is an incredibly important goal in therapeutic oncology. Tp53 mutations often induce conformational changes that inhibit the protein\u2019s ability to engage its DNA response element. Small molecule chaperones could theoretically restore the proper shape and activity, but this is a far more challenging design problem than the typical paradigm of designing inhibitors of protein function. Consequently, it is unsurprising that there are no approved p53-targeting drugs. COTI-2, a thiosemicarbazone with orphan-drug status for ovarian cancer, has proven an effective cytotoxic agent against various cancer cell lines in vitro, exhibited efficacy in vivo, and has demonstrated a good safety profile in Phase 1b human clinical trials. The proposed mechanism, direct engagement and refolding of mutant p53, has been supported by a combination of cell-based assays and transcriptomics data. We propose that this is an unlikely mechanism of action, and that instead COTI-2 is acting as a selective, well-tolerated, zinc chaperone to replace zinc ions lost to p53 mutants\u2019 deficient zinc-binding. We discuss that COTI-2 likely also works through other mechanisms but demonstrate that zinc-binding is necessary for the exceptional bioactivity. The promising therapeutic potential of this molecule and additional evidence for its zinc chaperone activity is discussed.

By leveraging the tensor-train data structure, a multilinear version of the AMUSE (Algorithm for Multiple Unknown Signals) algorithm for Koopman approximation (AMUSEt) was recently developed to identify CVs for biomolecular dynamics. To find slow CVs, AMUSEt transforms input features (e.g., pairwise atomic distances) into nonlinear basis functions (e.g., Gaussian functions) and encodes nonlinear basis functions within a tensor-train structure via the time-lagged correlation functions. Due to the need to fit these tensor-train data structures into computer memory, AMUSEt can handle only a limited number of input features. Consequently, AMUSEt relies on manually selecting and ranking features based on physical intuition to fully capture the slow dynamics. However, when applied to complex biological systems with numerous features, this selection and ranking process becomes increasingly challenging. To address this challenge, here we present AMUSET-TICA (AMUSEt-based Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis), a CV-identification method using time-structure-independent components (tICs) as the input features for AMUSEt. The key insight of AMUSET-TICA lies in its highly effective embedding of high-dimensional atomistic protein conformations, achieved by expanding orthogonal tICs into overlapping Gaussian basis functions through a tensor-product data structure. This eliminates the need for manually selecting and ranking input features for a wide range of biomolecular systems. We demonstrate that AMUSET-TICA consistently and significantly outperforms AMUSEt and tICA in identifying slow CVs for three different biomolecular systems: alanine dipeptide, the N-terminal domain of L9 (NTL9), and the FIP35 WW domain. For all these systems, the CVs generated by AMUSET-TICA accurately describe the slowest dynamical modes underlying these biological conformational changes. Furthermore, we show that AMUSET-TICA achieves performance comparable to deep-learning approaches like VAMPnets in identifying the slowest dynamical modes, while being significantly more computationally efficient in terms of CPU time. In addition, the CVs yielded by AMUSET-TICA provide insights into the folding mechanisms of NTL9 and the FIP35 WW domain, including CV3 and CV4 of the WW domain, which capture its two parallel folding pathways. We expect AMUSET-TICA can be widely applied to facilitate the investigation of biomolecular dynamics.", "date": "2025-01-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Thus, to speed up MOF development through computational work, a better (predictive) understanding on how functionalization impacts MOF synthesizability is needed. Here we use a data-driven approach where molecular dynamics simulations on 5,000+ MOFs are used to shed light on how functionalization affects MOF free energy, as the latter has been largely tied to MOF synthesizability and polymorph selection. More consistently in MOFs with higher void fractions, we find that functionalization generally reduces free energy, with entropy contributing significantly to this thermodynamic stabilization. Although with some functionalizations (-CF3, -F, -Br, -SH, -OH) the role of entropy is more apparent than with others (-CN, -CH3, -NO2, -NH3). Through uneven stabilization of polymorphs, we also find functionalization (more often with -Br, -CN and -CF3) as capable of altering polymorph (topology) selection relative to original non-functionalized polymorphic families. However, no switch in polymorph stability ever occurred when the original (unfunctionalized) polymorphs were separated by more than 1.42 kJ/mol per MOF atom. We show that machine learning can predict functionalization-induced free energy change of a parent MOF with a mean absolute error of 0.16 kJ/mol per atom, using only physical properties of the parent MOF and the functional group as input. The ML-based SHAP analysis agrees with human analysis on the functionalization molecular mass and the hydrogen fraction of the parent MOF being among the factors that influence change in free energy the most. Finally, we present a publicly accessible dynamic interface to visualize and navigate the free energy data , thereby encouraging the research community to engage with and utilize the data to help uncover new insights.

Yet, enantioselective processes involving N-tosylhydrazones are quite rare and challenging. In our continuing efforts in maneuvering Pd carbenes to synthesize complex heterocycles, we have developed a domino process for intercepting the enantioenriched alkyl-Pd species in a Mizoroki-Heck cascade. In this enantioselective domino process, N-alkyl acrylamides undergo a regiospecific 5-exo-trig cyclization to form an alkyl palladium species at a chiral quaternary carbon center that lacks a facile \u03b2-hydrogen. The alkyl palladium species formed is then trapped via carbene generated from bench-stable N-tosylhydrazones. The method constructs a chiral quaternary carbon center and provides direct access to chiral 3,3-disubstituted oxindoles with yields up to 91% and enantioselectivity >99% with tolerance for diverse functional groups. Mechanistic investigations revealed that a cationic Heck cascade is involved. The structure of the active catalytic species has been studied by HRMS analysis and linear relationship plot between the % ee of the catalyst and % ee of the product. Based on these experimental insights, computational studies of the catalytic cycle have been done to study the energetics of the steps involved. Further, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction has been justified by comparing the free energies of the diastereomeric transition states involved in the enantio-determining step. The constructed alkene handle next to the chiral center enhances the utility of this methodology. Apart from ease of functionalization, the proximity of the chiral center to the alkene, facilitates efficient transfer of chirality during transformations. This highlights the utility of the synthesized 3,3-disubstituted oxindoles as valuable chiral synthons. This has been demonstrated via a handful of synthetic transformations of the model oxindole and formal synthesis of five natural products, namely (+)-esermethole, \n(+)-physostigmine, (+)-deoxyseroline, (+)-phenserine and (+)-physovenine, which are a couple of steps apart in synthesis according to reported procedures.\n", "date": "2025-01-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Starting from model peptide Sanguinamide A, we synthesized a series of analogues in which the native thiazole moiety was replaced with various simple aromatic groups. This approach allowed us to systematically investigate how minimal changes in the nature of the aromatic group and the flexibility of the peptide backbone influence membrane permeability. Significant differences in permeability were observed among the analogues, and for those that were permeable, NMR spectroscopy revealed conformational changes in response to environment polarity. In addition to studying permeability, we assessed the impact of these chemical modifications on biological activity using a target-agnostic cell painting assay. While permeability generally correlated with biological activity, distinct differences in activity were observed depending on the specific aromatic group incorporated. These findings highlight the importance of backbone-embedded aromatic groups in modulating both membrane permeability and biological activity, offering valuable insights for the development of cyclic peptides as therapeutic agents.

In this study, we used unsupervised machine learning to classify chemical compounds based on infrared (IR) spectral images, without relying on prior chemical knowledge. The potential of machine learning for chemical classification was demonstrated by extracting IR spectral images from the Spectral Database for Organic Compounds and converting them into 208620-dimensional vector data. Hierarchical clustering of 230 compounds revealed distinct main clusters (A\u2013G), each with specific subclusters exhibiting higher intracluster similarities. Despite the challenges, including sensitivity to spectral deviations and difficulty of distinguishing delicate chemical structures in spectra with low transparency in the fingerprint area, the proposed image recognition approach exhibits good potential. Both principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering produced similar results. Furthermore, the method demonstrated high robustness to noise. The Tanimoto coefficient was used to evaluate the molecular similarity, providing valuable insights. However, some results deviated from chemists\u2019 intuitions. The study also highlighted that the scaling composition formulas and molecular weights did not affect the classification results because high-dimensional features dominated the process. A comparison of the clustering results obtained from molecular fingerprints, using the adjusted Rand index as a metric, indicated that the image data provided better classification performance than numerical data of the same resolution. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning with IR spectral image data for chemical classification and offers a novel perspective that complements traditional methods, although the classifications may not always align with chemists\u2019 intuitions.

A photoanode structure of particular promise is WO3 | BiVO4, where the formation of staggered heterojunction between nanostructured WO3 and a thin layer of BiVO4 mitigates charge carrier mobility limitations present for BiVO4 alone and suppresses recombination. Although these electrodes remain prone to photo-corrosion, this effect can be mitigated through the application of water oxidation surface co-catalysts. An additional challenge that has rarely been addressed in the literature to date is the need for strong adhesion to the substrate and mechanical stability of these photoelectrodes, so that they can withstand flow-induced shear stress exerted by the electrolyte in continuous flow under operational conditions. Herein, we propose a scalable route to synthesising WO3 | BiVO4 | NiFeOOH photoanodes  entirely by aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition (AA-CVD). The mechanical stability of the WO3 | BiVO4 heterojunction was optimised by tuning the morphology of the WO3 underlayer and improving its adhesion to the FTO transparent substrate. To address BiVO4 dissolution at the electrode | electrolyte interface, we fabricated a NiFeOOH co-catalyst by a novel AA-CVD method. This suppressed BiVO4 dissolution and enhanced the water oxidation performance of the photoanode, characterised by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) and chopped chronoamperometry. The photoanode materials were physically characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS).

Our method for growing WO3 | BiVO4 | NiFeOOH photoanodes is up-scalable, and therefore suitable for producing large-area demonstration devices, providing a pathway to commercial photoelectrochemical hydrogen production.

Recently, molecular representation learning (MRL) has emerged as a powerful approach to these challenges by decoupling feature extraction and property prediction. In MRL, a deep network is first trained to learn molecular features from large, unlabeled datasets and then finetuned for property prediction in smaller, specialized domains. The advent of foundation models, which are large models trained on diverse datasets capable of addressing various downstream tasks, has also transformed the field of DL. For example, large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 can be finetuned with minimal additional data for tasks considerably different from their training. While MRL methods have been widely applied across chemical applications, these models are typically trained from scratch on molecular data. This study proposes that foundation models can serve as an advantageous starting point for developing MRL models. We explore this idea by leveraging OpenAI's CLIP vision foundation model as the backbone for MoleCLIP, a molecular image representation learning framework. On standard benchmarks, MoleCLIP requires significantly less molecular pretraining data to match the performance of state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, MoleCLIP outperformed existing models on homogeneous catalysis datasets, emphasizing its robustness to distribution shifts, which allows it to adapt effectively to varied tasks and datasets. This successful application of a general foundation model to chemical tasks highlights the potential of innovations in DL research to advance synthetic chemistry and, more broadly, any field where molecular property description is central to discovery.", "date": "2025-01-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To investigate the potential use of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) as a strategy to protect recombinant proteins from gastrointestinal degradation and damage, and to provide good protection for fish against Aeromonas hydrophila, we employed high pressure homogenisation and ultrasonication methods for nanoencapsulation using glycerol distearate, propylene glycol dicaprylate as solid/liquid lipids, and polysorbate 80 as the surfactant, in varying ratios. The physicochemical properties of resulting nanostructured lipid carriers (size, homogeneity, charge, miscibility, shape) were assessed using dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). The antigen loading efficiency and release in a gastric buffer mimicking fish conditions was measured by micro BCA assay. NLC colloidal stability was assessed at pH values encountered in the fish gastrointestinal tract and storage conditions evaluated at 4 and 42 \u2103. Our results showed that while ultrasonication time influenced NLC size and dispersity, neither high pressure homogenisation nor ultrasonication impacted protein integrity. Formulation composition (solid and liquid lipid ratio and surfactant concentration) was crucial to the resulting nanoparticle properties and influenced protein loading capacity with an increase in solid lipid content leading to the highest antigen incorporation (58 \u00b1 10.9 %). All formulations with 90:10, 80:20 and 70:30 ratios of glycerol distearate to propylene glycol dicaprylate and 5 % polysorbate 80 resulted in NLCs with low dispersity, and sizes below 200 nm.

Leveraging the optimal biointerfacing properties of the UVO-treated pDPP3T, the validity of the technique in supporting cell viability and proliferation upon a semiconducting polymer was tested using electrical impedance spectroscopy.

Probabilistic kinetic modelling revealed a significant reduction in PEG MW after only a few \u2022OH-induced chain scissions on initial PEG molecules.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a significant concern in drug development, often leading to the discontinuation of clinical trials and the withdrawal of drugs from the market due to severe hepatotoxicity. This study explores the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) for DILI prediction, using molecular graph representations as the primary input.\n\nMETHODS. We evaluated several GNN architectures, including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), Graph Sample and Aggregation (GraphSAGE), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), using the latest FDA DILI dataset and other molecular property prediction datasets. We introduce a novel approach that creates a custom graph dataset, driven by molecular optimisation, that incorporates detailed and realistic chemical features such as bond lengths and partial charges as input into the GNN models. We have named our model approach DILIGeNN.\n\nRESULTS. DILIGeNN achieved an AUC of 0.897 on the DILI dataset, surpassing current state-of-the-art model in the DILI prediction task. Furthermore, DILIGeNN outperformed the state-of-the-art in other graph-based molecular prediction tasks, achieving an AUC of 0.918 on the Clintox dataset and 0.993 on the BBBP dataset and 0.953 on the BACE dataset, indicating strong generalisation and performance across different datasets.\n\nCONCLUSION. DILIGeNN, without relying on biological data, outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in DILI prediction that incorporate both chemical and biological data.

Here, we investigate the reactivity of formic acid on reconstructed Fe3O4(001) using a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction, and electronic structure calculations. We find that formic acid initially dissociates at low temperatures (< 80 K) into bidentate formate and a hydroxyl up to an initial dosed coverage of two HCOOH per Fe3O4(001) unit cell. At higher temperatures (> 450 K), formate largely decomposes along the dehydration pathway, producing CO and H2O, with dehydrogenation to CO2 being a minority side reaction. As a first step, water formation leads to surface oxygen extraction via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Computational studies reveal formate embedded in oxygen vacancies as a key intermediate in the CO formation mechanism. CO formation proceeds via two reaction pathways with desorption that peaks at 530 K on the hydroxyl-rich surface and 560 K on the hydroxyl-deficient surface. Atomic hydrogen coadsorption experiments and ab initio calculations reveal that the presence of surface hydroxyls reduces the CO formation barrier.

While these interactions are traditionally modeled using fixed-charge force fields, such approaches are not transferable among different molecular environments. Polarizable force fields, such as DRUDE, address this limitation by explicitly incorporating polarization effect. However, their performance does not uniformly surpass that of nonpolarizable force fields, since multiple factors such as bonded terms, dihedral correction maps, and solvent screening also modulate biomolecular dynamics. In this work, we study the Im7 protein to evaluate the structural and dynamic behaviors of non-polarizable (CHARMM36m) and polarizable (DRUDE2019) force fields relative to NMR experiments. Our simulations show that DRUDE better stabilizes \u03b1-helices than CHARMM36m, including shorter ones that contain helix-breaking residues. However, both force fields underestimate loop dynamics, particularly in the loop I region, due mainly to restricted dihedral angle sampling. Moreover, salt bridge population and dynamics reveal that DRUDE and CHARMM36m preferentially stabilize different salt-bridges. This variability arises from the interplay of ionic interactions, charge screening by the environment, and the flexibility of neighboring residues. Additionally, the latest DRUDE2019 variant, featuring updated NBFIX and NBTHOLE parameters for ion-protein interactions, demonstrated improved accuracy in modeling Na+-protein interactions. These findings highlight the need to balance bonded and non-bonded interactions along with dihedral correction maps while incorporating polarization effects to improve the accuracy of force fields to model protein structure and dynamics.", "date": "2025-01-20", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This review highlights the key properties of bulk heterojunction solar (BHJ) solar cells and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) that can be accurately computed using DFT, including electronic structure properties (HOMO-LUMO energy levels, bandgap energies, and exciton binding energies, which influence charge separation and transport); optical properties (absorption spectra and light-harvesting efficiency, essential for maximizing photon capture); charge transport properties (reorganization energies, electron, and hole mobilities, and charge transfer rates that govern carrier dynamics within devices); interfacial properties (energy alignment at donor-acceptor interfaces, contributing to efficient charge separation and minimizing recombination) and chemical reactivity descriptors (ionization potential, electron affinity, chemical hardness, and electrophilicity, which facilitate material screening for OSC applications).

With this technique, reaction \u201cfingerprints\u201d are created from the yields of a set of substrates subjected to several different reaction conditions.  The resultant fingerprints are clustered by similarity to reveal mechanistic relationships.  We have benchmarked this method with elimination reaction mechanisms, and used it to explore mechanistic relationships among C\u2013H activation, phenol cross coupling, and amination catalysts.  We determined that our method successfully categorizes elimination reaction mechanisms, as well as C\u2013H activation reaction mechanisms between eCMD, CMD, and SEAr.  Additionally, we found that due to the swift progress and discovery of new mechanisms in the C\u2013H activation field, much of the C\u2013H activation literature contains outdated mechanistic labels.  Our method was able to correct these labels, and can be used to quickly hypothesize a mechanism for new C\u2013H activation or amination catalysts with only 4-6 experiments.

Here, we use a stochastic reaction-diffusion model of thiosulfate oxidation by gas phase ozone to examine how the interface influences the multiphase reaction kinetics measured in levitated microdroplets using mass spectrometry. Building a realistic kinetic model of multiphase reactions requires both a detailed multistep reaction mechanism as well as the surface affinities of all reactants and products. Deep-UV Second Harmonic Generation spectroscopy is used to probe surface affinities of thiosulfate, sulfate, and sulfite, key species in the reaction mechanism. Thiosulfate has an appreciable surface affinity with a measured Gibbs free energy of adsorption of -7.29 \u00b1 2.47 kJ/mol in neutral solution, while sulfate and sulfite exhibit negligible surface propensity. The Gibbs free energy is combined with data from liquid flat jet ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to constrain the concentration of thiosulfate at the surface in the kinetic model. Kinetic simulations show that the primary reaction between thiosulfate and ozone occurs at the interface and in the bulk, with the contribution of the interface decreasing from ~65% at pH 5 to ~45% at pH 13. Additionally, sulfate, the major product of thiosulfate ozonation and an important species in atmospheric processes, can be produced by two different pathways at pH 5, one with a contribution from the interface of >70% and the other occurring predominantly in the bulk (>98%).

Locality-specific factors such as wages, diet, and material costs drive regional variability in NSS costs by up to 15-fold and CI up to 2-fold. Low-cost, low-CI typologies are predominantly in countries with lower human development indices (HDI 2-4), demonstrating alignment between sanitation need and NSS opportunity space. By elucidating key sustainability drivers and defining typologies, this work can support early-stage decision-making for NSS technology research, development, and deployment.", "date": "2025-01-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Water Purification", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Employing density functional theory based calculations and using a model system consisting of a ZrO2(111) support and a three-layer Ru nanorod, we find that O-vacancies are significantly stabilized only if they are in direct contact to the Ru nanorod, with the extent of stabilization depending on the distance between vacancy and the nearest Ru atom at the interface.

The Ru induced stabilization of the O-vacancies is closely coupled with the charge transfer from the support to the metal upon vacancy formation, which is true also in the presence of neighbored O-vacancies.  The CO adsorption energy can be substantially modified by four characteristic effects, including charge transfer from the support to the metal, coordination effects, a combination of COad induced deformation energies and changes in the interface energy and direct interactions between CO and partly reduced Zr surface ions directly neighbored to an O-vacancy, depending on the adsorption site and on the number and positions of the O-vacancies.

Here, the reaction takes place with a single substrate, which is converted to two transient intermediates of complimentary polarity under the influence of two different catalysts. The combination of these two polarity-matched inter-mediates gives the desired product. Due to the use of a single substrate, the reactions under divergent cooperative catalysis are expected to minimize the complications associated with traditional cooperative catalysis. The proof of this concept is demonstrated by an enantioselective redox-neutral coupling of branched allenylic alcohols, cooperatively catalyzed by iridium and Lewis acid. In the Lewis acid-catalytic cycle, racemic allenylic alcohol is transformed into an alpha,beta-unsaturated enol (cross dienol) through Meyer-Schuster-type 1,3-hydroxy transposition. On the other hand, in an independent process, catalyzed by a combination of an Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) complex and Lewis acidic Sc(OTf)3, allenylic alcohol is believed to produce an \u03b72-Ir(I)-bound allenylic carbocation intermediate, which is intercepted by the in situ generated cross dienol. Overall, starting from stable and easily accessible branched allenylic alcohols, the process combines Lewis acid-catalyzed 1,3-hydroxy transposition with Ir-catalyzed enantioselective allenylic substitution to furnish alpha\u2032-allenylic alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones, without using preformed carbon nucleophiles, in moderate to good yields generally with excellent enantioselectivities (up to >99.9:0.1 er). Detailed experimental and DFT studies helped shed light on the mechanism of the reaction, which revealed the initially formed bis-allenylic ether to be a substrate reservoir.", "date": "2025-01-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Stereochemistry; Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This strategy utilizes bench-stable reagents under mild conditions, delivering highly stereoselective trans-vinylboronates. However, predicting regioselectivity re-mains a challenge due to the complex interplay of ligand structures, alkyne substitution patterns, and reaction conditions.

Specifically, aryl bromides and chlorides undergo heterogeneous reduction in organic solvents at potentials more negative than \u20132 V vs E0\u2019 for the Fc/Fc+ couple (Fc = ferrocene). To decrease the overpotential for reduction reactions, electrocatalysis strategies are often employed. Here, we present an electrochemical method to reduce aryl bromides and chlorides that is initiated by an oxidation reaction at very mild potentials (~ 0 V vs Fc/Fc+). Specifically, electrochemical oxidation of an outer-sphere redox mediator, 1,1-dimethylferrocene, in dry N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) containing oxalate (C2O42\u2013), results in the homogeneous one-electron oxidation of C2O42\u2013. The resulting C2O4\u2022\u2013 decomposes in ~1 \u00b5s to release the carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2\u2022\u2013), a potent reductant that is oxidized to CO2 at \u20132.68 V vs Fc/Fc+. In this way, an oxidation reaction at very low electrode potentials enables the homogeneous reduction of aryl bromides and chlorides, which are otherwise directly reduced at very negative potentials. Using this method, selective hydrodehalogenations of electron-deficient aryl bromides and chlorides are carried out at a reticulated vitreous carbon anode with up to quantitative conversion yields. Cyclic voltammetry and finite difference simulations are used to characterize the hydrodehalogenation of 4-bromobenzonitrile via C2O42\u2013 oxidation.

Mechanistic studies suggest that this approach involves a covalent intermediate generated via the nucleophilic addition of the catalyst to the strained ring substrate, which serves as a key step in facilitating the reaction.", "date": "2025-01-22", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC 4.0"}

Fold-switching proteins are an expanding class of proteins that remarkably switch from one stable fold to another in response to subtle changes in the sequence or chemical environment, without populating unfolded or aggregated states. The polymorphism of these proteins permits important regulatory functions across biological processes and diseases, but also hinders their preparation and characterization using recombinant methods. To provide reliable access to fold-switching proteins, we used automated flow chemistry to establish the synthesis and to provide a robust platform for answering fundamental questions of protein folding with unnatural amino acids. The synthetic methods are demonstrated with 56-amino acid homologs of GA and GB, which were successfully synthesized and purified as sequences that are 95% and 98% identical. Biophysical studies show that the synthetic proteins adopt a folded conformation consistent with the 3-\u03b1 and 4\u03b2+\u03b1 conformations observed in prior studies. The success of these protein syntheses shows that automated flow chemistry continues to push the boundaries of high-fidelity protein synthesis, by enabling the preparation of polymorphic proteins that are sensitive to mutations.

In this work, we demonstrate how the thermally activated molecular rotation within the crystals of chiral binuclear N-Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) Au(I) complexes can modulate their circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The enantiomeric pair of chiral binuclear NHC Au(I) complexes, 1-R and 1-S, exhibit a distinct C2-symmetric conformation, derived from non-equivalent orientations of phenyl moieties at the chiral NHC ligands. The variable-temperature solid-state 2H NMR studies revealed that these non-equivalent phenyl moieties undergo fast rotational motion above 273K, potentially promoting symmetrization of molecular structures in the crystal. The latter, in combination with the inherent chirality of 1-R and 1-S complexes, results in the emergence of the temperature-dependent CPL behavior in the crystalline state with a noticeable increase of luminescence intensity and dissymmetry factors upon cooling from 333K to 213K (|\u0394ICPL|: + ~300%; |glum|: + ~50%).

Interestingly, a plateau in storage moduli (G\u2019) was observed for UHMW PDMAm hydrogels with a sufficiently high DPtarget (> 5,000), indicating a transition to the entanglement-dominated regime, with no contribution from crosslinks to the overall modulus, thus indicating the formation of highly entangled hydrogels. These hydrogels exhibit enhanced properties such as high toughness and resistance to swelling despite their vanishingly small crosslinking densities. Furthermore, even when equipped with cleavable crosslinkers, the UHMW PDMAm hydrogels resist degradation due to dense entanglements which act as transient crosslinks preventing the gels from swelling, while sparse covalent crosslinks help to maintain their structural integrity and avoid chain disentanglement.

For this investigation, two widely utilised biodegradable polymers, polylactide (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL), were selected as the polymer matrices. Hydroxyapatite (HAp) powders with average particle sizes of 10 \u03bcm and 60 nm were used as fillers. A series of composites were prepared using twin-screw extrusion and injection moulding techniques, with micro- and nanoparticle HAp concentrations of 20 wt% and 40 wt% for PLA and 20 wt% for PCL. The produced materials were subjected to comprehensive analysis, including morphological evaluation (scanning electron microscopy), thermal characterisation (differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis), rheological testing and mechanical property assessment at both micro (micro indentation) and macro (tensile, impact strength) scales. Our research had three main objectives: to carry out a comparative analysis of composites with different polymer matrices, to evaluate the effect of the filler on the properties of the given polymer matrix and, finally, to investigate the effect of the filler particle size on the overall performance of the composites. In general, PLA-based materials exhibited brittleness and strong polymer-filler interactions, whereas PCL-based materials were ductile and showed weak polymer-filler interactions. The use of nanometric filler resulted in more desirable mechanical properties and improved polymer melt stability compared to composites containing micrometric filler.

Wettability is therefore an important factor impacting the water production and low resistivity pays in organic-rich mudrocks. Development of reliable models for hydrocarbon-in-place and water saturation estimation requires knowledge about wettability of mudrocks and the factors affecting it. A significant fraction of mudrock is composed of kerogen \u2013 insoluble organic matter in mudrocks \u2013 and therefore the properties of kerogen can considerably affect the mudrock properties.\n\nStudying rock physics and interfacial properties of kerogen remains an area of active research. Kerogen is often considered as hydrocarbon-wet in reservoir characterization. Despite this, wettability of kerogen is not fully understood and quantified. Assumptions made about the wettability of kerogen affects interpretation of borehole geophysical measurements such as electromagnetic measurements. It is therefore important to quantify wettability of kerogen as a function of relevant factors. For instance, the chemical structure and composition can vary as a function of kerogen type, which affects its surface properties such as wettability. In addition, processes such as thermal maturation induce changes in the chemical composition and structure. Thermal maturation decreases oxygen and hydrogen content and increases aromaticity. Oxygen containing function groups are also altered during thermal maturity. Moreover, changes in temperature and pressure also alter surface properties and affect the wettability of kerogen. However, the impact of different functional groups present in kerogen and reservoir temperature and pressure on kerogen wettability are yet to be quantified through a fundamental study.\n\nMolecular simulation studies can be used to understand the kerogen wettability for a wide range of chemical position of kerogen. In a previous work, molecular dynamics simulation was used to quantify wettability of kerogen. However, simplified kerogen structures were used which does not capture the heterogeneity and complexity of the kerogen structure. Moreover, there have been no studies which consider the impact of functional groups such as carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, and the impact of temperature and pressure conditions on the wettability of kerogen. There has been no previous experimental study to reliably determine wettability of pure kerogen, because of the challenges associated with kerogen isolation and with determining wettability of powders. \n\nI propose to use a combination of experimental and molecular simulation-based approaches to understand wettability of kerogen. First, the impact of composition and thermal maturity of kerogen on wettability of organic-rich mudrock will be studied using experimental and molecular simulation methods. The impact of reservoir temperature and pressure conditions on kerogwn wettability would be quantified using molecular dynamics simulations. The methods proposed in the thesis will help in improving the understanding of wettability of organic-rich mudrocks. The sensitivity of wettability of kerogen on the electrical resistivity measurements of organic-rich mudrock will be quantified using a combination of experimental methods and numerical simulation. This study could also provide insight into water production issues in shale and will potentially improve formation evaluation and the understanding of fluid flow mechanisms in organic-rich mudrocks. \n", "date": "2025-01-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) represent a promising technology for both mobile and stationary applications but their poor operational lifetimes and frequent faults are barriers to their commercial ubiquity. Thus, detecting and addressing faults rapidly is crucial to extend PEFC lifetimes and enhance their viability for alternative electricity generation. White-box and black-box models are widely used to diagnose PEFC faults; this work introduces a novel black-box approach using multifrequency Walsh function perturbation signals to diagnose polymer electrolyte membrane PEFC faults. This method improves signal-to-noise ratios in the electrical response of the fuel cell, increasing measurement accuracies without causing cell damage from excessive perturbation amplitudes. Using the voltage response of the PEFC as the diagnostic variable, dense neural networks (DNNs), 1-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs), and support vector machines (SVMs) were investigated for fault classification. Initial testing revealed that all models could accurately detect normal, drying, and starvation conditions in an individual PEFC, with the 1D-CNN and SVMs achieving 100% diagnostic accuracy. When tested on data from a different PEFC, the models exhibited poor generalisation abilities; nevertheless, combining data from multiple PEFCs significantly improved diagnostic accuracy, with the 1D-CNN displaying superior generalisation performance, particularly when trained with only a small portion of new data. The network\u2019s convolutional architecture facilitates effective parameter sharing and local connectivity, enhancing computational efficiency and reducing errors. Thus, it emerges as the most suitable model for the diagnostic framework, capable of managing varying datasets from different PEFCs while maintaining high accuracies.

To circumvent this preliminary screening experiment for small molecule libraries, retention time prediction had been achieved previously by use of commercial modeling methods. However, these retention time prediction models can have limited applicability when built from smaller datasets and are less effective when constructed from disparate data collected under differing chromatography conditions. Having thousands of measured retention times from high-throughput physiochemical screening, we sought to leverage these data for the construction of predictive models for a standard preliminary method enabling high-throughput purification of macrocyclic peptide libraries. Utilizing 4549 analytes and their retention times from high-throughput physiochemical screening, a structure to retention time model was built using a graph invariant network, a form of artificial neural network architecture. Once fitted to high-throughput screening data, the model was re-trained with standard gradient method data, a technique known as transfer learning. Through transfer learning, a training set of 80 analytes yielded a neural network model, that when evaluated against a test set of 24 analytes, displays high performance metrics with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.82 and mean average error of 0.088 minutes, or 1.26% of the gradient time. This model has been deployed internally as a dash-app to help democratize the use of the developed models and is being used for selecting purification methods based on analyte structure.", "date": "2025-01-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Chemoinformatics; Separation Science; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Traditional approaches typically employ strong, unidirectional intermolecular interactions as the core princi-ples for tecton and synthon design. In contrast, the interactions between complex biomolecules, such as proteins, take advantage of the cooperativity of multiple, weak, polyaxial non-covalent interactions (NCIs), working in concert, to generate strongly associated super-structures. Such design principles have yet to be successfully applied to small molecule crystal engineering. Here we show that the tetra-halopyridyl (THP) unit fulfils these tectonic criteria.

Here, we present a library of 30 cationic micelle nanoparticles (MNPs) formulated from diblock copolymers with reactive poly(pentafluorophenol acrylate) backbones modified with a diverse set of amines. This library systematically varies in nitrogen-based cationic functionalities, exhibiting a spectrum of properties that encompass varied degrees of alkyl substitution (A1-A5), piperazine (A6), oligoamine (A7), guanidinium (A8), hydroxylation (A9-A10) that vary in sidechain volume, substitution pattern, hydrophilicity, and pKa to assess parameter impact on mRNA delivery. In vitro delivery assays using GFP+ mRNA across multiple cell lines reveal that amine sidechain bulk and chemical structure critically affect performance. Using machine learning analysis via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) on 3,780 experimental data points, we mapped key relationships between amine chemistry and performance metrics, finding that amine-specific binding efficiency was a major determinant of mRNA delivery efficacy, cell viability, and GFP intensity. Micelles with stronger mRNA binding capabilities (A1 and A7) have higher cellular delivery performance, whereas those with intermediate binding tendencies deliver a higher amount of functional mRNA per cell (A2 and A10). This indicates that balancing the binding strength is crucial for performance. Micelles with hydrophobic and bulky pendant groups (A3, A4, and A5) tend to induce necrosis during cellular delivery, highlighting the significance of chemical optimization. A cationic amphiphile identified as A7 displaying a primary and secondary amine, consistently demonstrates the highest GFP expression across various cell types and in vivo achieving high delivery specificity to lung tissue upon intravenous administration. Moreover, we established a strong correlation between in vitro and in vivo performance using Multitask Gaussian Process models, linking amine properties directly to both delivery efficacy and biodistribution.

Here we study capacity fade in non-aqueous RFBs using the bipolar 1,2,4-benzotriazin-4-yl radical (1) in a symmetric cell (10/-\u255110/+). Active material crossover does not contribute to capacity fade in these symmetric RFBs, allowing the determination of intrinsic electrolyte stability. We show that the negative redox reaction (10/-) acts as a \u2018reporter\u2019 of electrolyte degradation, which reveals that capacity fade occurs in a non-linear (autocatalytic) fashion caused by acid-induced decomposition of the commonly used supporting salt anion PF6- in the posolyte solution. This is shown to be a universal degradation reaction in non-aqueous RFBs with PF6- supporting salts. Although the posolyte is not negatively affected by acidic degradation products, crossover of acid to the opposite compartment leads to capacity-limiting protonation of the negolyte active material. By replacing PF6- with other anions, the stability of these non-aqueous electrolytes was substantially improved.

Two-dimensional conjugated metal-organic frameworks (2D c-MOFs) are promising for electrocatalysis due to their diverse and predictable structures, high electronic conductivity, and efficient utilisation of well-defined active centers. Herein, we report the first systematic investigation of 2D c-MOFs with Ni-X4 (X = O or N) moieties for glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) to investigate factors impacting both electrocatalytic activity and selectivity. The study involves [Ni3(HHTQ)2]n (HHTQ = 2,3,7,8,12,13-hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline), [Ni3(HHTP)2]n (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene), [Ni3(HITP)2]n (HITP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene), and [Ni3(HATI)2]n (HATI = 2,3,7,8,12,13-hexaiminotriindole), revealing superior GOR performance of Ni3(HHTQ)2. In situ-13C electrochemical nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Raman spectroscopies provide insights into the GOR mechanism and identify Ni-O4 sites as active centers. Theoretical exploration further demonstrates that the high GOR activity of Ni3(HHTQ)2 originates from strong adsorption of intermediates and weak interlayer interactions, which improve the transfer process and overall kinetics. Our research proves the feasibility of exploiting 2D c-MOFs as remarkable GOR catalysts, opening up an inspiring avenue for the elaborate design of advanced electrocatalysts, which is of great significance for the development of renewable energy conversion and storage technologies.", "date": "2025-01-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Hence, this study uses sporopollenin (exine) as a heterogeneous support. 31P CP/MAS NMR showed that conventional H3PO4 cleaning of spores not only produces empty sporopollenin (ESP) but also functionalizes it with mono- and di-phosphoesters (41:59).

Recently, a drug delivery nanovehicle incorporating an anticancer compound targeting the HER2 receptor in breast cancer has been developed. This demonstrates how useful aptamer-based nanovehicles are for creating indicators unique to cancer, reducing side effects, and enhancing treatment effectiveness. The interior of the nanovehicle contains a protamine-aptamer complex that binds to epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG: an anticancer medication), while the surface comprises a HER2 affinity aptamer. The nanovehicle is a carrier bound to cancer cells and transports the anticancer medication into them. Our hypothesis is that the HB5 aptamer on the nanovehicle surface interacts with the particular HER2 receptor area to identify HER2+ cancer cells. AlphaFold web server was used for the HER2 receptor 3D structure. We conducted in silico investigations to estimate aptamers' three-dimensional structure and interactions with HER2 and protamine. We discovered that the surface aptamer creates a particular linear shape necessary for HER2 receptor interactions. The inner aptamer is small and forms a patterned structure with the protamine, releasing EGCG into the cytoplasm in the presence of abundant cytoplasmic ATP.

This study investigates the uni-axial densification of slurry-casted LPSCl tapes, focusing on PSD refinement and compaction pressure. Wet milling has been identified to effectively reduce PSD to submicron levels while preserving structural integrity and near-pristine conductivity. A critical pressure threshold (~350 MPa) for tape-casted LPSCl slurries (2.5% hydrated poly(acrylonitrile-co-butadiene)) was identified, where ionic conductivity peaks due to particle fusion and the formation of conductive networks.

However, these fluids exhibit unique properties (density, viscosity, and slip length) that deviate from their bulk counterparts and critically impact flow dynamics. Understanding and characterizing these properties is essential for designing efficient nanofluidic systems. Traditionally, numerous models, often complex and disparate, have been used to describe these properties. The current abundance of models makes selecting the most suitable one for numerical simulations a challenging task.  In this paper, we propose a simpler, unified framework: a single power-law model for each property such as for density $\\displaystyle \\rho(H)/\\rho_o = 1+ m_1~H^{-n_1}$, viscosity $\\displaystyle \\eta(H)/\\eta_o  = 1+ m_2~H^{-n_2}$, and the slip length $\\lambda(H) = \\lambda_o + m_3~H^{-n_3}$ (where $m_1, m_2, m_3, n_1, n_2, n_3, \\lambda_o$ are the free fitting parameters). This model effectively captures data from experiments and simulations, even where existing literature employed diverse models. A key advantage of our model lies in its mathematical properties. Continuity and a continuous derivative ensure seamless implementation into numerical simulations and theoretical predictions, leading to more understable, stable and accurate results. Additionally, the model adheres to physical principles, predicting convergence to bulk properties as channel size increases. Further this proposed unified power-law model for density, viscosity, and slip length compared to existing exponential models, offers flexibility where it captures non-linear relationships and diverse data curvatures. Interpretability with clear physical meaning for parameters. Adaptability to combine with other functions for complex phenomena. Simplicity for easy parameter estimation, model interpretation, and computations. Robustness and less sensitive to outliers and noise in data and with fewer parameters to easy relate to underlying physics and scaling-laws. Hence proposed model's simplicity, smoothness, physical validity and generality make it a significant heuristic model for efficient design and optimization of nanoscale devices using theory and simulations across a wide range of applications.", "date": "2025-01-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanoscience; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Nanofluidics; Fluid Mechanics; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

This work elucidates the structure-activity relationship in photoresponsive RuNO(salen) complexes and paves the way for innovative application of materials that can release NO with specific timing and duration of light irradiation, such technology has promising implications in catheter-related infection prevention, where NO release could act as an antimicrobial agent, minimizing infection risk through local, controlled release within catheter systems.

The most important modifications include arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (CPP).

Due to their amphiphilic properties and high number of basic amino acid residues, lipid conjugates of CPP exhibit difficult characteristics in regard to their plasma bioanalysis with LC-MS/MS instruments. These especially include challenging chromatography with extensive carry-over and minimal extrac-tion recovery, and, due to large numbers of basic amino acids and the resulting immobility of protons, resistance against collision-induced dissociation. We developed a surrogate quantification of a CPP-lipid conjugate relying on elimination of the lipid part by phospholipase D digestion. Chromatographic separation was only feasible with trifluoro acetic acid (TFA)-based mobile phases. Ion suppression caused by TFA was reversed by post-column addition of aqueous ammonia. Efficient extraction of the surrogate peptide fragment was achieved by protein precipitation with TFA. This enabled the highly sensitive quantification of the CPP-lipid conjugate in plasma in the low picomolar range (lower limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL; 34 pM). The assay was validated ac-cording to the pertinent recommendations of the ICH M10 guideline on bioanalytical method validation and applied to the deter-mination of the intravenous pharmacokinetics of the CPP-lipid conjugate in Beagle dogs. The established strategy can be used as a general approach to the bioanalysis of amphiphilic lipid conjugates and especially the TFA-based UPLC-MS/MS analysis with post-column desolvation of TFA adducts by ammonia is a feasible approach for the highly sensitive quantification of arginine-rich peptides and other related substances with challenging chromatographic characteristics.", "date": "2025-01-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry; Mass Spectrometry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This paper presents an autonomous experimentation workflow to conduct an iterative, on-demand synthesis, and structural characterization of colloidal gold nanoparticles to map composition information to nano-scale structure in a closed loop. We introduce a unified experimental planning framework based on differentiable models of the shape of a spectrum to solve the two categories of problems tackled using autonomous experimentation:  a) quantitatively mapping compositional parameters to regions with particular behavior in structure or property i.e. phase mapping;  b) inverse design of materials with a target structure or function i.e. material retrosynthesis. Using functional data analysis, we describe a data-driven computational model to map correlations between the compositions (i.e., synthesis or processing conditions) to the shape of a characterization curve (e.g.: UV-Vis spectroscopy). By integrating generative pre-training, active learning, and high-throughput experimentation, we train a surrogate model capable of predicting characterization curves across compositional spaces. The model-based approach to experimental planning provides convergence criteria for terminating iterative experimentation by measuring the model's test accuracy. We demonstrate the utility of trained differentiable models in generating phase maps of a seed-mediated growth of colloidal gold nanoparticles for extracting design rules, secondary interaction effects (between synthesis components and their impact on nanoparticle structure), and efficient navigation of different gold nanoparticle morphologies space.  We then describe an application of the differentiable models to colloidal gold nanoparticle retrosynthesis using a gradient-based optimization to showcase the construction of a self-driving lab doubly capable of structure optimization and phase map generation.

DFT is chosen for its ability to account for electron correlation effects beyond the mean-field approximation, a limitation found in earlier approaches such as the Hartree-Fock (HF) method. By incorporating electron correlation, DFT provides a more accurate description of molecular properties, making it highly suitable for analyzing complex molecular structures like those found in chlorobutadienes. The methodology adopted in the study comprises four key steps. First, the molecular structure of each isomer was created. Next, the geometry of the isomers was optimized using DFT methods to ensure the most stable configurations for further analysis. The third step involved computing the vibrational frequencies of the molecules using the B3LYP functional, with different basis sets applied depending on the isomer under study. Finally, the simulated infrared (IR) spectra generated through DFT were compared with existing data from the literature to validate the findings and assess the accuracy of the computational model. The study focuses on nine different Tetrachlorobutadiene (TCBD) isomers, each with unique configurations of hydrogen and chlorine atoms. These structures were visualized using Molden software, and the IR spectra for each isomer were obtained using DFT, specifically the B3LYP and B3LYP-D3BJ functionals. The analysis of the IR spectra revealed characteristic peaks corresponding to various functional groups within the TCBD molecules. Notable vibrational modes included C-Cl stretching, C=C stretching and bending, and C-H stretching and bending, which are essential in identifying the chemical composition of the isomers. A comparative analysis was conducted between DFT and the previously employed Hartree-Fock (HF) method. The results clearly showed that DFT was more efficient in identifying functional groups within the TCBD isomers. DFT provided IR spectra with well-defined peaks that were consistent across all isomers, offering a more detailed and accurate molecular analysis. In contrast, the HF method, while capable of detecting some functional groups, was less consistent and notably missed certain peaks, particularly in the C-H stretching region. This demonstrates the flexibility and superior accuracy of DFT, making it a more reliable tool for molecular structure analysis, especially in cases involving complex electron correlation effects. Despite DFT\u2019s effectiveness, the overlapping of peaks in the IR spectra necessitates additional analytical techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or Raman spectroscopy, to enhance the differentiation of isomers.", "date": "2025-01-27", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Theory - Computational; Quantum Computing; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

First, we investigated, for the first time, the catalytic activity of bifunctional admixtures of Cu-ZnO-ZrO2 (CZZ) and a silicoaluminophosphate, SAPO-34, for CO2 hydrogenation to DME, and optimized their reactivity with an emphasis on identifying optimum synthesis conditions for CZZ including Cu:Zn:Zr molar ratio, and ageing and calcination temperatures. The highest methanol (MeOH) productivity (10.8 mol kgcat-1 h-1) was observed for CZZ-611 aged at 40\u00b0C and calcined at 500\u00b0C. When coupled with SAPO-34, CZZ/SAPO-34 reached 20% CO2 conversion and 56% DME selectivity at optimized conditions (260\u00b0C, 500 psig, and 2000 mL gCZZ-1 h-1) and was stable for 50 h time-on-stream. Next, we performed kinetic modeling to translate lab-scale findings to industrial packed-bed reactors followed by a techno-economic analysis (TEA) with cradle-to-gate environmental footprint evaluation to evaluate its industrial applicability. TEA of a 20,000 tpy DME plant revealed raw material costs as the main operating costs drivers (H2 cost comprises 47% of total cost). Considering green H2 ($4/kg H2) and captured CO2 as feed, the minimum DME selling price (MDSP) was $3.21/kg, ~3.6x higher than market price ($0.88/kg).

This causes a reversal of cation-protein affinities relative to water, and [EMIM]+ displays greater preferential solvation of the protein at higher concentrations. This reversal is a consequence of the saturation of the cation-specific protein surface binding sites, and the different molarities of water in the bulk solutions implied by the cation sizes.

Enzymes, notably due to their high selectivity, offer significant advantages for organic synthesis. However, industrial implementation remains limited due to challenges such as free enzyme instability, enzyme inhibition, and difficulties in catalyst recovery and reuse. The coupling of biocatalysis with membrane technology in enzyme-membrane-reactors (EMR) holds significant potential for process intensification, as it paves the way to continuous flow synthesis concatenated with product purification, and biocatalyst recovery. By allowing flow hybrid processes (i.e. simultaneous biocatalytic reactions and membrane operations in one-pot), EMR have the potential to increase reaction yields and kinetics, and reduce downstream processing requirements. This review explores recent trends and advancements in EMR for the production of pharmaceutical building blocks and fine chemicals. We examine the combination of enzymes with both polymeric and ceramic membranes, highlighting their respective benefits and limitations. We cover both EMR processes where free enzymes are used separately from membrane devices, and EMR processes employing membrane-immobilized enzymatic reactors. As enzyme immobilization in/on solid supports has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing enzyme stability and reusability, we argue that the development of such membrane-immobilized enzyme reactors is of prime importance for the pharmaceutical industry. These insights aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the role and recent applications of EMRs in advancing biocatalytic processes within the fine chemistry and pharmaceutical industry.", "date": "2025-01-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Pharmaceutical Industry; Reaction Engineering; Biocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of red/NIR TADF emitters. The emission wavelengths were rationally tuned by modulating the strength of the electron-donating groups, DMAC, PXZ, and DPACz, that are coupled to the same electron-accepting PyBP (dibenzo [f, h] pyrido [2,3-b]quinoxaline) moiety.

DMACPyBP, with the weakest donor, has the highest \u03a6PL of 62.3%, the smallest \u0394EST of 0.03 eV, and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate constant (kRISC) of 0.5 \u00d7 105 s-1 in a 1 wt% doped film in CBP.

Aging-induced changes in the short-range structure and charge compensation were evaluated through a multi-model quantitative analysis of the operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy data. While the electrochemical aging did not result in particle cracking, soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy data revealed the reconstruction of the cathode surface to a dense rock salt-like layer after long-term cycling, which acts as a kinetic trap for Li+ diffusion.

The results reveal a direct solvent migration mechanism, where excitation to the MLCT states leads to the breaking of hydrogen bonds to the cyanide ligands within less than 100 fs, followed by the formation of hydrogen bonds with the negatively charged bipyridyl ligand by the same water molecules. Furthermore, the MLCT and MC states show very distinct solvent responses, which are overlapping in time, as governed by the electronic dynamics.", "date": "2025-01-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

In contrast, the synthesis of HU from PC with other secondary amines led to much lower fractional conversion.

In the slope region, sodium initially adsorbs at high-binding energy defect sites and subsequently intercalates between graphene layers, adsorbing at low-binding energy defect sites, correlating with different slopes observed during initial sodiation. Initial irreversibility arises from sodium trapping at surface defects and solid electrolyte interface formation. In the plateau region, sodium simultaneously intercalates and fills pores, influenced by pore size, interlayer spacing, and defect concentration.

Traditionally, the synthesis of these compounds has relied on the direct installation of the chiral C(sp\u00b2)\u2212N(sp\u00b2) bond or enantioselective modification to the peripheral groups to increase steric around the C\u2212N axis. However, these methods are limited in substrate scope and are constrained by the type and size of functional groups compatible with these strategies.

This method expands the substrate scope, tolerating a wide variety of positional, steric, and electronic substitution patterns that were previously challenging or inaccessible. Furthermore, the phosphite-mediated approach is versatile, facilitating the synthesis of atroposelective pyridone, lactam, and acyclic anilide. These results demonstrate a conceptually new strategy for atroposelective synthesis that complements traditional methods in terms of substrate diversity.

Hydrothermal MMoO4 (M = Fe, Ni, Co) formation is governed by the initial pH, implying the involvement of pH-dependent polyoxomolybdate cluster chemistry. Nevertheless, the exact role of clusters in forming molybdates remains poorly understood. Here, we use in situ X-ray total scattering to follow the hydrothermal syntheses of MMoO4 and related hydrates at various pH values, using Co-based reaction mixtures as our primary model system. Focussing on the structural investigation of non-crystalline species, we find no heteropolyoxometalates under the probed conditions. This contrasts our results from reported MWO4 formation pathways and thereby reiterates the element-specific nature of nucleation chemistry. Moreover, we observe pH- and temperature-dependent formation of bimetallic phases that cannot be explained by polyoxomolybdate chemistry alone. Our results therefore point towards a product-directing role of the 3d metal complex speciation under hydrothermal conditions, emphasising the mechanistic complexity of ternary oxide formation.", "date": "2025-01-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Inorganic Chemistry; Materials Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

We conducted ambient Hg species measurements and enriched isotopic tracer experiments in waters of two contrasting marine environments, the oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea (MED) and the mesotrophic Atlantic Ocean (ATL). Maximum subsurface MeHg levels were ~2 times higher in the MED compared to the ATL, essentially driven by higher DMHg concentrations (0.45 \u00b1 0.06 vs 0.16 \u00b1 0.02 pM).

Molecular similarity, commonly assessed as the distance between molecular fingerprints, is integral to applications such as database curation, diversity analysis, and property prediction. AI tools frequently rely on these similarity measures to cluster molecules under the assumption that structurally similar molecules exhibit similar properties. However, this assumption is not universally valid, particularly for continuous properties like electronic structure properties. Despite the prevalence of fingerprint-based similarity measures, their evaluation has largely depended on biological activity datasets and qualitative metrics, limiting their relevance for non-biological domains. To address this gap, we propose a framework to evaluate the correlation between molecular similarity measures and molecular properties. Our approach builds on the concept of neighborhood behavior and incorporates kernel density estimation (KDE) analysis to quantify how well similarity measures capture property relationships.

One approach is the use of PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) degraders, which induce the formation of ternary complexes between the target protein and E3 ligase, leading to ubiquitination and degradation of the target protein. Understanding the conformational behavior of PROTACs in solutions and how it relates to their pharmacokinetic properties is crucial for optimizing PROTAC design and efficacy. Due to the large size and flexibility of PROTACs and their chameleonic character, it is essential to understand their conformational ensemble, and how it depends on the environment, rather than considering a single structure. Here, we introduce a novel methodology for exploring PROTAC conformational behavior using atomistic simulations. We employ the enhanced sampling method Parallel-Bias Metadynamics, where we bias generic local collective variables, specifically all rotatable dihedral angles, thereby avoiding the considerable challenge of identifying suitable global collective variables for biasing. The methodology allows for obtaining free energy surfaces of global CVs via reweighting, thus giving valuable insight into the conformational ensemble. We apply the method to the prototypical case of the MZ1 PROTAC degrader, which targets bromodomain-containing protein-4 (BRD4) for degradation via the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase, and elucidate its conformational behavior in different solvents, allowing us to gain insights into the chameleonic property of MZ1. Our methodological framework is generally applicable to large flexible molecules like PROTACs and the results demonstrate its efficiency, laying the groundwork for similar investigations for other PROTACs and other \"beyond-rule-of-5\" drug candidates. This work provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of PROTACs, ultimately contributing to developing novel therapeutics for \"undruggable\" diseases.", "date": "2025-01-30", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Murakami; Hiroyuki Matsuzaki", "abstract": "Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have developed rapidly in the last decade, primarily because of improvements in their photovoltaic (PV) performance. However, methods of characterization and analyses for PSCs remain immature, mostly because of the complex multilayered PSC structure. The sandwiched structure of i-type perovskite photoabsorbers having both p-type hole transport materials (HTMs) and n-type electron transport materials (ETMs) facilitates charge separation in the perovskite photoabsorber and thus plays a crucial role in developing efficient PSCs. However, this structure forms multiple heterointerfaces, which more easily undergo structural changes than the bulk and are difficult to characterize independently. Herein, we propose a method for differentiating the bulk and heterointerface properties in PSCs in terms of their carrier dynamics by using excitation power dependence on photoluminescence lifetime (EPD-PLL) measurements. This method exploits the intrinsically different carrier mobility behavior of the PSC components; specifically, the carrier mobilities within perovskite photoabsorbers are significantly higher (by over three orders of magnitude) than those in carrier-transport materials (CTMs). Strong excitation causes carrier accumulation in the CTM bulk, resulting in time-dependent carrier injection, which could be indicative of the bulk CTM properties. In contrast, weak excitation leads to time-independent carrier injection from the perovskite to CTMs, correlating with heterointerface properties. Hence, EPD-PLL measurements differentiate carrier dynamics between the CTM bulk and heterointerfaces. The method was tested by investigating the thermal degradation mechanism of typical Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs, revealing that the contribution of heterointerface deterioration by thermal stress can be neglected. The degraded PSCs had unusual PV properties, unlike those of fresh PSCs, and the EPD-PLL results confirmed these unusual properties, facilitating effective PSC characterization. The proposed method can be applied to the characterization of other PSCs, contributing to the further development of PSCs by addressing a missing point: the characterization and analysis of PSCs.", "date": "2025-01-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The rational introduction of a molecular metal complex acting as a catalyst at a specific location is an effective approach to activate conjugated polymer photocatalysts for the selective conversion of small molecules, such as carbon dioxide. However, the photocatalytic activity of the conjugated polymer/metal complex hybrids has not been satisfactory. In particular, there is still much room for improvement in polymer structure engineering to maximise the activation of a molecular complex catalyst centre by photoexcited electrons. This work demonstrates the strong impact of side chains and ligand structures, which do not significantly affect the optical properties of the polymers, on their photocatalytic performance for CO2 reduction.

To facilitate consumers in their transition towards a diet higher in plant-based proteins, the food industry aims to closely mimic the structure of meat of animal origin. Currently, insights into the structuring process are gained, for example, by imaging samples using MRI or confocal microscopy. Existing software for analysing these images, however, often lacks the ability to quantitively analyse structure and anisotropy. Here, we present a new image processing method, named Rotated Fourier Transform (RFT), that enables the quantification of anisotropic structures of extrudates from multimodal images acquired at different length scales. RFT can provide a single measure of structural anisotropy, namely the weighted order parameter (WOP), for either the entire image or subregions thereof. RFT utilises Fourier transforms to obtain the dominant angles representing the structural orientation detected within the image. For each dominant angle, we further calculate an amplitude relative to the background within each sub-image. These amplitudes depend on the signal-to-noise levels of the corresponding angular features, which enables reducing the influence of insignificant features on the WOP. Here, we used RFT to quantify anisotropy in images of soy protein concentrate HME samples. We identified both anisotropic and isotropic regions and further showed that the relative spatial extent of the anisotropic region, perpendicular to the flow direction, increases along the cooling die. While applied in this paper to the specific case of soy HME samples, RFT is a generic method applicable to any image displaying anisotropic features. Thus, RFT is a powerful and robust tool for comprehensive quantification of food structures and beyond.", "date": "2025-01-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Food", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

We observe that purely data-driven models are unbiased, simple, and accurate in their predictions of experimental measurements when provided with sufficient data but are difficult to fully constrain and interpret. In contrast, chemistry-informed models exhibit significantly improved chemical interpretability and consistency, providing a detailed description of the separation process, while achieving high accuracy through ensemble averaging. Overall, the dominant species predicted to be extracted into the organic phase is UO2(NO3)2(DEHiBA)2, agreeing with experimental slope analysis, thermodynamic modeling, EXAFS, and crystal structures. This work demonstrates that leveraging the fundamental structure of the problem can lead to efficient learning schemes that provide both accurate predictions and chemical insights at low computational cost.", "date": "2025-01-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemical Kinetics", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

This is because the simulation of high-resolution features in the structure of large macromolecular assemblies, such as de-novo protein assemblies, is computationally demanding when it needs to cover a broad range of length scales. Conventional methods such as the numerical approximation to the Debye equation or the use of spherical harmonics do not scale well as the size of the assembly increases, which limits their application to small structures (e.g. individual proteins). This work explores the effectiveness of a Monte Carlo method to simulate and fit scattering curves for large biomolecular assemblies spanning over ranges covering atomic and molecular detail, as well as large scale (100\u2019s of nm) features. Due to its excellent speed and scalability, it can be combined with a fitting algorithm to extract structural features from experimental small-angle scattering curves in biomolecular assemblies that are otherwise intractable for interpretation. This work first demonstrates the effectiveness of the tool using experimental small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data from tile-like proteins that assemble into 1D tube-like macromolecular structures. The diameter distribution of tubes is extracted from SAXS fits, and this quantitatively compared with distributions from electron microscopy. SAXS data is also obtained from 2D sheet-like protein assemblies and the proposed method is used to quantify structural features such as the separation distance between protein building blocks and the flexing of the sheet.

These highly oxidizing anions react with the deposited Zn, leading to its dissolution and the consequent loss of capacity.

However, aside from their high costs, these membranes often fail to prevent the transport of corrosive halides. Recently, there has been growing interest in utilizing Ti3C2Tx (MXene) for membrane applications.

While detailed calculations have revealed the bonding mechanism for model systems such as H$_2^+$ and H$_2$, a consensus on larger systems exhibiting covalent C-C bonds has been elusive. Here, the bond energetics of the model system ethane are inspected by decomposing the 54-dimensional electronic wavefunction into repeating tiles related by permutation of like spin electrons, using our dynamic Voronoi Metropolis sampling algorithm. Within each tile, electrons are found to correspond to distinct chemical identities. The energies of the electrons are inspected as a function of C-C bond length, and the dominant contributors to the binding energy are found to be the pair of electrons in the C-C bonding region, as expected. A decomposition of the C-C bond energy into kinetic and potential terms shows that the bonding energetics mirror those of H$_2$, with an initial dip in kinetic energy upon methyl fragment interaction, followed by an increase in kinetic energy and decrease in potential energy as the bond is formed. The decrease in potential energy is accompanied by a marked contraction of C-C bonding electron density. These results show the similarity between the model C-C bond and that of H$_2$, and that wavefunction tiles are a convenient method to decompose the contributors to covalent bonding energetics in high dimensionalities, agnostic to the method used to calculate the wave function.", "date": "2025-01-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The proposed system leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze images captured during gas capture processes, generating semantically rich and grammatically accurate captions that describe the visual content. At the core of the system is a hybrid architecture that integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for high-level feature extraction from input images and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for sequential caption generation. The CNN effectively identifies and extracts relevant features from the images, while the GRU models the temporal dependencies inherent in the data, allowing for the generation of coherent and contextually appropriate captions. This dual approach not only enhances the accuracy of the captions but also facilitates a deeper understanding of the processes being monitored. In addition to caption generation, the system incorporates a predictive control module that utilizes the generated captions to forecast future behaviors of the gas capture processes. This predictive capability enables operators to make informed decisions, optimizing the efficiency and effectiveness of pollutant gas management in industrial applications.

For molecules in external magnetic fields, the Berry curvature is essential to achieve a qualitatively correct description of nuclear motion. Here, it is responsible for screening the Lorentz forces acting on moving nuclear charges. This connection has recently been exploited to derive a new type of population analysis known as Berry charges. In this work, we derive a novel sum rule for the molecular Berry curvature. This pseudomomentum-translational sum rule is then used to reveal the connection between Berry charges and the well-known generalized atomic polar tensor (GAPT) charges. Furthermore, we present an efficient integral-direct implementation of the molecular Berry curvature for molecules in finite magnetic fields into the TURBOMOLE program suite. This is used to further demonstrate the connection between Berry and GAPT charges for a variety of larger molecules, comparing the results to other established types of partial charges.", "date": "2025-01-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Kunze; Rebecca Schaefer; Giovanna Palumbo; Benjamin Kugelmann; Stephan Wagner; Sven Lammich; Regina Feederle; Michael Willem; Rudolf A. Werner; Matthias Brendel; Simon Lindner", "abstract": "Microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), act as first responders in the context of brain injury or neurodegeneration. Their ability to switch between different neuroprotective and neurotoxic phenotypes, plays a central role in maintaining brain homeostasis. Recently, the P2Y12 receptor (P2Y12R) has been identified as a promising molecular biomarker for microglia, as its expression level is directly dependent on microglia phenotype and function. A decline in P2Y12R expression is indicative of damage, microglial malfunction or chronic neuroinflammation, as observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Novel therapeutic strategies aiming to modulate microglia phenotypes directly depend on matching diagnostic tools for success control. Accordingly, a suitable P2Y12R positron emission tomography (PET) tracer is hypothesised to provide valuable in vivo information regarding microglia activation within the CNS. However, P2Y12R PET tracers with sufficient brain retention for neuroimaging have not been reported so far. Herein, we report the first brain-permeable P2Y12R PET tracer for in vivo imaging of P2Y12R-positive microglia. Nicotinate [18F]12 exhibited nanomolar affinity for the target receptor and favourable in silico parameters. Tracer specificity was proven by in vitro autoradiography (ARG) and brain uptake was confirmed by PET imaging in wild-type (WT) mice and ex vivo biodistribution. Ex vivo metabolite analysis indicated the exclusive presence of intact tracer in the mouse brain, with no evidence of any radio-metabolites. The tracer showed a reduced uptake in microglia-depleted mice after PLX-5622 diet, in comparison to WT and Trem2 knock-out (Trem2-/-) mice. Ex vivo immunohistochemistry (IHC) results and PET data revealed a strong correlation between microglia, P2Y12R expression levels and tracer uptake giving strong evidence that P2Y12 PET signal reflects P2Y12R binding. This novel tracer represents an important step forward in P2Y12 PET imaging in the context of neuroinflammation.", "date": "2025-01-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

F4_MIL-140A(Ce) is a recently discovered MOF that displays a cooperative CO2 adsorption mechanism enabled by concerted rotation of the aromatic rings of the tetrafluoroterephthalate linkers, giving rise to a step-shaped isotherm. Here, we shed light on the key role played by the degree of fluorination of the organic linker in such a cooperative mechanism by synthesising novel Fx_MIL-140A(Ce) (where x = 2 or 3) analogues and characterising them with a wide range of experimental techniques, including powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas sorption analysis, in situ infrared spectroscopy and adsorption microcalorimetry. We found that the removal of fluorine atoms from the linker switches off the cooperative mechanism observed in the perfluorinated prototype, leading to Langmuir-type CO2 adsorption isotherms for Fx_MIL-140A(Ce). The removal of fluorine also results in a higher CH4 adsorption capacity and, therefore, in a progressive decrease of CO2/CH4 selectivity. In situ infrared spectroscopy using CO as a probe confirmed that CeIV sites are accessible in Fx_MIL-140A(Ce), but their Lewis acidity decreases at lower degrees of fluorination. Adsorption microcalorimetry revealed that the CeIV sites are accessible to CO2 even at low loading and that a higher degree of fluorination leads to a stronger interaction with CO2. Desorption of the crystallisation water coordinated to CeIV from Fx_MIL-140A(Ce) appears to induce a similar phase transition to that observed in F4_MIL-140A(Ce), suggesting that a cooperative mechanism persists when water is the adsorbate, likely because of its ability to establish hydrogen-bonding like interactions with the linker. The collective evidence points towards reduced steric hindrance around the most favourable adsorption sites for CO2 as the main factor responsible for the absence of a cooperative adsorption mechanism in Fx_MIL-140A(Ce) MOFs.

A key step toward this goal has been made with the GEMS approach to biomolecular dynamics [Sci. Adv. 10, eadn4397 (2024)]. This work introduces the SO3LR method that integrates the fast and stable SO3krates neural network for semi-local interactions with universal pairwise force fields designed for short-range repulsion, long-range electrostatics, and dispersion interactions. SO3LR is trained on a diverse set of 4 million neutral and charged molecular complexes computed at the PBE0+MBD level of quantum mechanics, ensuring a comprehensive coverage of covalent and non-covalent interactions. Our approach is characterized by computational and data efficiency, scalability to 200 thousand atoms on a single GPU, and reasonable to high accuracy across the chemical space of organic (bio)molecules. SO3LR is applied to study units of four major biomolecule types, polypeptide folding, and nanosecond dynamics of larger systems such as a protein, a glycoprotein, and a lipid bilayer, all in explicit solvent.

Here, we developed a robust and scalable solid phase extraction (SPE) proto-col in 96-well format for human urine and plasma and optimized it for a panel of 94 highly diverse environmen-tal and food-related contaminants (LogP -0.7 ~ 6.8). Extraction recoveries (RE) and signal suppression and en-hancement (SSE) were determined using targeted LC-MS/MS. Acceptable REs (60% - 140%) were achieved for >70% of all analytes, and acceptable SSE values (60% -140%) for 86% and 90% in urine and plasma, respective-ly. Subsequently, the method was transferred to 96-well format, significantly improving throughput to meet the capacity requirements needed for exposome-wide association studies (ExWAS).

The developed workflow is thus not only superior for future high-throughput targeted exposomics but also offers an option for NTA applications.

The systematical and diverse study of both nitrating agents and activating reagents was conducted using high-throughput experimentation, to afford high quantity and high quality data generation. General trends have been identified and correlated to the electronic property of the heteroarene, notably the difficult nitration of electron-poor heteroarenes was highlighted. Original combinations of reagents were found to perform well in nitration reactions.

While coarse-graining is straightforward once the mapping between atomistic and coarse-grained resolution is defined, reintroducing the atomistic details is still a non-trivial process called backmapping. Here, we present ART-SM, a fragment-based backmapping framework that learns from atomistic simulation data to seamlessly switch from coarse-grained to atomistic resolution. ART-SM requires minimal user input and goes beyond state-of-the-art fragment-based approaches by selecting from multiple conformations per fragment via machine learning to simultaneously reflect the coarse-grained structure and the Boltzmann distribution. Additionally, we introduce a novel refinement step to connect individual fragments by optimizing specific bonds, angles, and dihedral angles in the backmapping process.     We demonstrate that our algorithm accurately restores the atomistic bond length, angle, and dihedral angle distributions for various small and linear molecules from Martini coarse-grained beads and that the resulting high-resolution structures are representative of the input coarse-grained conformations.      Moreover, the reconstruction of the TIP3P water model is fast and robust, and we demonstrate that ART-SM can be applied to larger linear molecules as well.     To illustrate the efficiency of the local and autoregressive approach of ART-SM, we simulated a large realistic system containing the surfactants TAPB and SDS in solution using the Martini3 force field. The self-assembled micelles of various shapes were backmapped with ART-SM after training on only short atomistic simulations of a single water-solvated SDS or TAPB molecule.     Together, these results indicate the potential for the method to be extended to more complex molecules such as lipids, proteins, macromolecules, and materials in the future.", "date": "2025-01-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

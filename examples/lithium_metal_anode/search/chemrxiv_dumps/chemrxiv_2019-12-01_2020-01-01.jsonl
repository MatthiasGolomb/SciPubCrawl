While its molecular origin is well known, intricate\nSCO behaviours\nare increasingly common, in which the spin transition occurs concomitantly to <i>e.g.</i> phase transformations, solvent\nabsorption/desorption, or order-disorder processes. The computational modelling\nof such cases is challenging, as it requires\naccurate spin state energies in the solid state. Density Functional Theory\n(DFT) is the best framework, but most DFT functionals are unable to balance the spin state energies. While few hybrid functionals perform\nbetter, they are still too expensive solid-state minima searches in\nmoderate-size systems. The best alternative is to dress cheap local (LDA) or\nsemi-local (GGA) DFT functionals with a Hubbard-type correction (DFT+<i>U</i>). However, the\nparametrization of U is not\nstraightforward due to the lack of reference values, and because ab initio parametrization methods\nperform poorly. Moreover, SCO complexes undergo notable structural changes upon\ntransition, so intra- and inter-molecular interactions might play an important\nrole in stabilizing either spin state. As a consequence, the U parameter depends strongly on the\ndispersion correction scheme that is used. In this paper, we parametrize U for nine reported SCO compounds (five\nbased on Fe<sup>II</sup>, <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> and four based on Fe<sup>III</sup>, <b>6</b>-<b>9</b>)\nwhen using the D3 and D3-BJ dispersion corrections.

A concerning implication of increased marijuana use is the alarming number of individuals who report driving under the influence of the drug. It is estimated that nearly 12 million people in the US alone have driven a vehicle while being under the influence of marijuana. To counterbalance the growing use of marijuana and potential associated dangers, it is imperative to develop detection technologies for marijuana usage. An electrochemical-based detection technology, akin to the alcohol breathalyzer, would provide an attractive solution to this growing societal problem. The first step toward this goal is to develop a fundamental reaction that converts tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive substance in marijuana, to a derivative with diagnostic spectroscopic changes.

Since transport of charge carrier and/ or energy across interfaces is desirable for a large number of applications, the use of pi-conjugated ligands becomes more and more interesting. Among those, compounds which show stimuli-responsive properties, particularly molecular switches are fascinating, as one hopes to be able to adjust the properties of the interfaces by demand. However, how the properties of such special ligands get influenced by the presence of a semiconductor and vice-versa is under debate. Here, ammonium-modified azobenzene compounds were selected as prototypes for molecular switches and organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites on the semiconductor side. The class of ammonium-lead-halide phases as prototypes is special, because in addition to surface functionalization of 3D crystals, organic compounds can be truly incorporated into the crystal as 2D phases yielding, for example, layered Ruddelsden-Popper phases. We present photoswitchable azobenzene ligands with varying head group lengths for the synthesis of 2D and 3D hybrid perovskite phases. Energy transfer mechanisms are influenced by the length of the molecular spacer moiety, which determines the distance between the pi-system to the semiconductor surfaces. We find huge differences in the photoswitching behaviour between the free, surface coordinated versus ligands integrated inside perovskite layers. Photoswitching of azobenzene ligands incorporated to 2D phases is nearly quenched, while the same mechanism for coordinating ligands is greatly improved, compared to the free ligands. The improvement originates from an energy transfer from the perovskite to the azobenzene, which is strongly distance dependent. This study provides evidence for the photoswitching behaviour of azobenzene as ligand for hybrid perovskites and the dependence of the head group between a chromophore and the perovskite phase.</p>", "date": "2019-12-06", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Both approaches were critically evaluated with regards to their applicability for multifunctional, ionizable compounds.

All analyzed toxins are rather polar with an average log Kow < 1 and an observed maximum log Kow of 2.7. Furthermore, the comparison of experimental data to those of commonly used prediction models showed that the latter match the former with only minorly increased errors.

However, the most popular computational schemes for NMR calculation\u2014based on density functional theory (DFT) and gauge-including atomic orbital (GIAO) methods\u2014still suffer from ambiguities in structural assignments. Using state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) techniques, we have developed a DFT+ML model that is capable of predicting 13C/1H NMR chemical shifts of organic molecules with high accuracy. The input for this generalizable DFT+ML model contains two critical parts: one is a vector providing insights into chemical environments, which can be evaluated without knowing the exact geometry of the molecule; the other one is the DFT-calculated isotropic shielding constant. The DFT+ML model was trained with a dataset containing 476 13C and 270 1H experimental chemical shifts. For the DFT methods used here, the root-mean-square-derivations (RMSDs) for the errors between predicted and experimental 13C/1H chemical shifts are as small as 2.10/0.18 ppm, which is much lower than the typical DFT (5.54/0.25 ppm), or DFT+linear regression (4.77/0.23 ppm) approaches. It also has smaller RMSDs and maximum absolute errors than two previously reported NMR-predicting ML models. We test the robustness of the model on two classes of organic molecules (TIC10 and hyacinthacines), where we unambiguously assigned the correct isomers to the experimental ones.

The potential for generalization of the site-selectivity to other [2+2+n] reactions is demonstrated by identification of a Cp<sub>2</sub>Zr-mediated [2+2+1] / metallacycle transfer sequence for synthesis of an alkynylated, selenophene-annulated PAH.

Atomic level control of material processing is required for fabrication of thin films of these materials at nanoscale device sizes. Thermal Atomic Layer Etch (ALE) of metal oxides, in which up to one monolayer of the material can be removed, can be achieved by sequential self-limiting fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions at elevated temperatures. However, to date a detailed atomistic understanding of the mechanism of thermal ALE of these technologically important oxides is  lacking. In this paper, we investigate the hydrogen fluoride pulse in the first step in the thermal ALE process of HfO2 and ZrO2 using first principles simulations. We introduce Natarajan-Elliott analysis, a thermodynamic methodology, to compare reaction models representing the self-limiting (SL) and continuous spontaneous etch (SE) processes taking place during an ALE pulse. Applying this method to the first HF pulse on HfO2 and ZrO2 we found that thermodynamic barriers impeding continuous etch are present at ALE relevant temperatures.

Such a decomposition is achieved by introducing two additional\nconstrained intermediate states in which only one direction of CT is permitted. These\ntwo \u201cone-way\u201d CT states are variationally relaxed such that the associated nuclear\nforces can be readily obtained. This allows for a facile integration into the previously\ndeveloped adiabatic EDA scheme so that the molecular property changes arising from forward and back donation can be separately assigned. Using ALMO-EDA augmented\nby this VFB model, we investigate the energetic, geometric, and vibrational features of\ncomplexes composed of CO and main group Lewis acids (BH3, BeO/BeCO3), and complexes of the N2, CO, and BF isoelectronic series with [Ru(II)(NH3)5]2+. We identify\nthat the shift in the stretching frequency of a diatomic \u03c0-acidic ligand (XY), such as\nCO, results from a superposition of the shifts induced by permanent electrostatics and\nbackward CT: permanent electrostatics can cause an either red or blue shift depend-\ning on the alignment of the XY dipole in the dative complex, and this effect becomes\nmore pronounced with a more polar XY ligand; the back-donation to the antibonding\n\u03c0 orbital of XY always lowers the X\u2212Y bond order and thus red-shifts its stretching\nfrequency, and the strength of this interaction decays rapidly with the intermolecular\ndistance. We also reveal that while \u03c3 forward donation contributes significantly to energetic stabilization, it affects the vibrational feature of XY mainly by shortening the\nintermolecular distance, which enhances both the electrostatic interaction and back-\nward CT but in different rates. The synergistic effect of the forward and backward\ndonations appears to be more significant in the transition metal complexes, where the\nforward CT plays an essential role in overcoming the strong Pauli repulsion. These\nfindings highlight that the shift in the XY stretching frequency is not a reliable metric\nfor the strength of \u03c0 back-donation. Overall, the VFB-augmented EDA scheme that\nwe propose and apply in this work provides a useful tool to characterize the role played\nby each physical component that all together lead to the frequency shift observed. </p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>", "date": "2019-12-12", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this contribution, we investigate the perovskite/organic interface in more detail and conclude that non-covalent interactions between the organic layer and perovskite result in surface trap passivation. In addition, band bending results in a charge space region at the perovskite/rubrene interface, which precharges the rubrene interface with holes. Upon initial illumination, electrons can rapidly transfer to the excited triplet state of rubrene, followed by efficient TTA upconversion.

Despite the clinical success of approved photosensitizers (PSs), their application is limited due to poor water solubility, aggregation, photodegradation, and slow clearance from the body. To overcome these drawbacks, research efforts are devoted towards the development of metal complexes and especially Ru(II) polypyridine complexes based on their attractive photophysical and biological properties. Despite the recent research developments, the vast majority of complexes utilize blue or UV-A light to obtain a PDT effect, limiting the penetration depth inside the tissue and therefore, the possibility to treat deep-seated or large tumors. To circumvent these drawbacks, we present the first example of the DFT guided search for efficient PDT PSs with a substantial spectral red shift towards the biological spectral window. Thanks to this design, we have unveiled a Ru(II) polypyridine complex, which causes phototoxicity in the very-low micromolar-to-nanomolar range at clinically relevant 595 nm, in monolayer cells as well as in 3D multicellular tumor spheroids.<br />", "date": "2019-12-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinorganic Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Disentangling the factors which control the spectral shift is complicated by the stabilization of a charge-transfer-like excitation of the dye in polar environments. Predicting the emission therefore requires modeling both the relaxation of the environment and the corresponding evolution of the excited state. Here an approach is presented in which (i) the local environment is sampled by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the dye and solvent; (ii) the electronically excited state of Prodan upon light absorption is predicted by numerical quantum mechanics (QM); (iii) iterative relaxation of the environment around the excited dye by MD coupled with evolution of the excited state is performed; (iv) the emission properties are predicted by QM. The QM steps are computed using many-body Green's functions theory in the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter Equation with the environment modeled as \ffixed point charges, sampled in the MD simulation steps. Comparison to ultrafast time resolved transient absorption measurements demonstrates that the iterative MM/QM approach agrees quantitatively with both the polarity dependent shift in emission and the timescale over which the charge transfer state is stabilized.

One of the main difficulties for its development comes from the very low natural abundance of oxygen-17, which implies that isotopic labeling is generally needed prior to NMR analyses. However, 17O-enrichment protocols are often unattractive in terms of cost, safety, and/or practicality, even for compounds as simple as metal oxides. Here, we demonstrate how mechanochemistry can be used in a highly efficient way for the direct 17O-isotopic labeling of a variety of s-, p- and d-block oxides which are of major interest for the preparation of functional ceramics and glasses: Li2O, CaO, Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, and ZrO2. For each oxide, the enrichment step was performed under ambient conditions in less than 1 hour and at low cost, which makes these synthetic approaches highly appealing in comparison to the existing literature. Using high-resolution 17O solid state NMR and Dynamic Nuclear Polarization, atomic-level insight into the enrichment process is achieved, especially for titania and alumina. Indeed, it was possible to demonstrate that enriched oxygen sites are present not only at the surface, but also within the oxide particles. Moreover, information on the actual reactions occurring during the milling step could be obtained by 17O NMR, both in terms of their kinetics and the nature of the reactive species. Finally, it was demonstrated how high resolution 17O NMR can be used for studying the reactivity at the interfaces between different oxide particles during ball-milling, especially in cases when X-ray diffraction techniques are uninformative. More generally, such investigations will be useful not only for producing 17O-enriched precursors efficiently, but also for understanding better mechanisms of mechanochemical processes themselves. <br />", "date": "2019-12-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Materials Processing; Interfaces; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Structure", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here, we report a novel method based on graph neural network to predict solvation free energies. Previous studies considered only the solute for solvation free energy prediction and ignored the nature of the solvent, limiting their practical applicability. The proposed model is an end-to-end framework comprising three phases namely, message passing, interaction and prediction phases. In the first phase, message passing neural network was used to compute inter-atomic interaction within both solute and solvent molecules represented as molecular graphs. In the interaction phase, features from the preceding step is used to calculate a solute-solvent interaction map, since the solvation free energy depends on how (un)favorable the solute and solvent molecules interact with each other. The calculated interaction map that captures the solute-solvent interactions along with the features from the message passing phase is used to predict the solvation free energies in the final phase. The model predicts solvation free energies involving a large number of solvents within the limits of chemical accuracy. We also show that the interaction map captures the electronic and steric factors that govern the solubility of drug-like molecules and hence is chemically interpretable.</div>", "date": "2019-12-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In order to optimize sensor effectiveness, the enzyme tertiary structure needs to be preserved upon immobilization to retain the enzyme\u00b4s catalytic activity. Due to the nature of GOx, it suffers from tendency to denature when immobilized at a solid surface, methods to optimize enzyme stability are of great importance. Here, we introduce the study of the interaction of GOx to the highly curved surface of 20 nm gold nanoparticles (AuNP) that shows how placing a monolayer of enzyme where the enzyme spreads thin at the AuNP surface still provides stable catalytic performance up to14 days compared to enzymes free in solution. Moreover, by increasing enzyme density and creating a molecularly crowded environment at the highly curved nanoparticle surface, which limits the size of the enzyme footprint for attachment, the activity per enzyme can be enhanced up to 300%. This is of great importance for implementing stable and sensitive sensor technologies that are constructed by enzyme-based nanoparticle scaffolds. Here, we show by using the conditions that maintain GOx structure and function when limiting the enzyme coating to an ultra-thin layer, the design and construction of ultrafast responding diagnostic sensor technology for glucose can be achieved, which is crucial for monitoring rapid fluctuations of for instance, glucose in the brain.", "date": "2019-12-18", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanocatalysis - Catalysts & Materials; Nanocatalysis - Reactions & Mechanisms", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Exposure of the cyclopropenone SAM to UV-A light initiated the efficient photochemical decarbonylation of the cyclopropenone moiety, revealing the strained alkyne capable of undergoing the interfacial strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition (SPAAC). Irradiated SAMs were derivatized with a series of model azides with varied hydrophobicity to demonstrate the generality of this chemical system for the modification and fine-tuning of the surface chemistry on gold substrates.

As the self-assembly process is confined to the surface/interface by mostly nonspecific attractive interactions, an open question is how these interfacial interactions affect multicomponent self-assembly. To gain a mechanistic understanding of the roles of surface environment in DNA origami self-assembly, here we studied the oligonucleotide-assisted folding of a long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA scaffold) that was end-tethered to a dynamic surface, which could actively regulate the DNA-surface interactions. The results showed that even weak surface attractions can lead to defective structures by inhibiting the merging of multiple domains into complete structures. A combination of surface anchoring and deliberate regulation of DNA-surface interactions allowed us to depart from the existing paradigm of surface confinement via nonspecific interactions and enabled DNA origami folding to proceed in a solution-like environment. Importantly, our new strategy retains the key advantages of surface-mediated self-assembly. Moreover, surface-anchored oligonucleotides could sequence-specifically initiate the growth of DNA origamis of specific sizes and shapes. Our work opens up new opportunities for encoding information into a surface and expressing the information into complex DNA surface architectures for potential nanoelectronics and nanophotonics applications. In addition, our new approach to surface confinement may facilitate the 2D self-assembly of other molecular components, such as proteins, as maintaining conformational freedom may be a general challenge in the self-assembly of complex structures at surfaces.</b><br /><br />", "date": "2019-12-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biological Materials; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

To elucidate the molecular role of mucins in flu pathogenesis, we constructed a synthetic glycocalyx to investigate membrane-tethered mucins in the context of IAV binding and fusion. We designed and synthesized lipid-tethered glycopolypeptide mimics of mucins and added them to lipid bilayers, allowing chemical control of length, glycosylation, and surface density of a model glycocalyx.

At high surface densities asialo mucin mimics inhibited IAV binding to underlying glycolipid receptors and this density correlated to the mucin mimic\u2019s conformational transition. Using a single virus fusion assay, we observed that while fusion of virions bound to vesicles coated with sialylated mucin mimics was possible, the kinetics of fusion were slowed in a mucin density-dependent manner.

To obtain these energies, we use equation-of-motion coupled cluster theory up to the highest technically possible excitation order for these systems (CC3, EOM-CCSDT, and EOM-CCSDTQ), selected configuration interaction (SCI) calculations (with tens of millions of determinants in the reference space), as well as the multiconfigurational \ud835\udc5b-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2) method. All these approaches are applied in combination with diffuse-containing atomic basis sets. For all transitions, we report at least CC3/aug-cc-pVQZ vertical excitation energies as well as CC3/aug-cc-pVTZ oscillator strengths for each dipole-allowed transition. We show that CC3 almost systematically delivers transition energies in agreement with higher-level methods with a typical deviation of \u00b10.04 eV, except for transitions with a dominant double excitation character where the error is much larger. The present contribution gathers a large, diverse and accurate set of more than 200 highly-accurate transition energies for states of various natures (valence, Rydberg, singlet, triplet, \ud835\udc5b \u2192 \ud835\udf0b\u2605, \ud835\udf0b \u2192 \ud835\udf0b\u2605, . . . ). We use this series of theoretical best estimates to benchmark a series of popular methods for excited state calculations: CIS(D), ADC(2), CC2, STEOM-CCSD, EOM-CCSD, CCSDR(3), CCSDT-3, CC3, as well as NEVPT2. The results of these benchmarks are compared to the available literature data.</p></div></div></div>", "date": "2019-12-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Machine learning (ML, e.g., artificial neural network, ANN, or Gaussian process, GP) models for this task are limited by training data availability and predictive uncertainty quantification (UQ). We overcome such limitations by using efficient global optimization (EGO) with the multi-dimensional expected improvement (EI) criterion. EGO balances exploitation of a trained model with acquisition of new DFT data at the Pareto front, the region of chemical space that contains the optimal trade-off between multiple design criteria. We demonstrate this approach for the simultaneous optimization of redox potential and solubility in candidate M(II)/M(III) redox couples for redox flow batteries from a space of 2.8M transition metal complexes designed for stability in practical RFB applications. We employ latent-distance-based UQ with a multi-task ANN to enable model generalization that surpasses that of a GP. With this approach, ANN prediction and EI scoring of the full 2.8M complex space is achieved in minutes. Starting from ca. 100 representative points, EGO improves both properties by 3-4 standard deviations in only five generations. Analysis of lookahead errors confirms rapid ANN model improvement during the EGO process, achieving suitable accuracy for predictive design in the space of transition metal complexes.

Here, we explore the application of methods from uncertainty quantification to theoretical spectroscopy, with the ultimate goal of providing systematic error bars for calculated spectra. As a first target, we consider distortions of the underlying molecular structure as one important source of uncertainty. We show that by performing a principal component analysis, the most influential collective distortions can be identified, which allows for the construction of surrogate models that are amenable to a statistical analysis of the propagation of uncertainties in the molecular structure to uncertainties in the calculated spectrum. This is applied to the calculation of X-ray emission spectra of iron carbonyl complexes, of the electronic excitation spectrum of a coumarin dye, and of the infrared spectrum of alanine. We show that with our approach it becomes possible to obtain error bars for calculated spectra that account for uncertainties in the molecular structure.

Multiconfigurational wave functions, on the other hand, can provide a detailed understanding of the electronic structure and chemical bond of such systems. In the complete-active-space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method one performs a full configuration interaction calculation in an active space consisting of active electrons and active orbitals. However, CASSCF and its variants require the selection of these active spaces. This choice is not black-box; it requires significant experience and testing by the user, and thus active space methods are not considered particularly user-friendly and are employed only by a minority of quantum chemists. Our goal is to popularize these methods by making it easier to make good active space choices. We present a machine learning protocol that performs an automated selection of active spaces for chemical bond dissociation calculations of main group diatomic molecules. The protocol shows high prediction performance for a given target system as long as a properly correlated system is chosen for training. Good active spaces are correctly predicted with a considerably better success rate than random guess (larger than 80% precision for most systems studied).

In this Letter, we show that, in contrast to previous claims, the third-order algebraic diagrammatic construction, ADC(3), does not yield transition energies of the same quality as the third-order coupled cluster method, CC3. There is indeed a significant difference in terms of accuracy between the two approaches, as we clearly and unambiguously demonstrate here thanks to extensive comparisons with several hundreds high-quality vertical transition energies obtained with FCI, CCSDTQ, and CCSDT. Direct comparisons with experimental 0-0 energies of small- and medium-size organic molecules support the same conclusion, which holds for both valence and Rydberg transitions, as well as singlet and triplet states. In regards of these results, we introduce a composite method that we named ADC(2.5) which consists in averaging the ADC(2) and ADC(3) excitation energies. Although ADC(2.5) does not match the CC3 accuracy, it significantly improves the ADC(3) results, especially for vertical energies.

Using in situ infrared spectroelectrochemistry, we disclose the contrasting influence of electrolyte competition on reversible CO binding to Au and Cu catalysts.

The divergent role of electrolyte competition for CO adsorption on Au vs. Cu leads to a ~600 mV difference in the potential region where CO accumulates on the two surfaces. The contrasting CO adsorption stoichiometry on Au and Cu also explains their disparate reactivity: water adsorption drives CO liberation from Au surfaces, impeding further reduction, whereas carbonate desorption drives CO accumulation on Cu surfaces, allowing for further reduction to hydrocarbons.

However, the mechanisms for ORR are generally poorly understood. Here we report an extensive experimental and first-principles theoretical study of the ORR at nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxides (NrGO). We synthesize three distinct NrGO catalysts and investigate their chemical and structural properties in detail via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and thin-film electrical conductivity. ORR experiments include the pH dependences of 2e- versus 4e- ORR selectivity, ORR onset potentials, Tafel slopes and H/D kinetic isotope effects. These experiments show very different ORR behavior for the three catalysts, both in terms of selectivity and the underlying mechanism which proceeds either via coupled proton-electron transfers (CPETs) or non-CPETs. Reasonable structural models developed from DFT rationalize this behavior. The key determinant between CPET vs. non-CPET mechanisms is the electron density at the Fermi level under operating ORR conditions. Regardless of the reaction mechanism or electrolyte pH, however, we identify the ORR active sites as sp2 carbons that are located next to oxide regions. This assignment highlights the importance of oxygen functional groups, while details of (modest) N-doping may still affect the overall catalytic activity, and likely also the selectivity, by modifying the general chemical environment around the active site.", "date": "2019-12-17", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical Organic Chemistry; Carbon-based Materials; Electrocatalysis; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Physical and Chemical Properties", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

However, several clinical trials focusing on A\u03b2-targeting agents have failed recently, and thus new therapeutic leads are focusing on alternate targets such as tau protein pathology, A\u03b2-metal induced oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. To address these different pathological aspects of AD, we have employed a multifunctional compound (MFC) L1 that integrates A\u03b2-interacting and metal-binding functional groups in a single molecular framework. By perturbing the interactions between the A\u03b2 species and metal ions during the A\u03b2 aggregation process, L1 alleviates the formation of neurotoxic A\u03b2 oligomers and promotes the formation of nontoxic, amorphous A\u03b2 aggregates. Furthermore, the significant antioxidant activity and strong metal chelating ability of L1 are operating cooperatively to rescue neuroblastoma N2A cells from Cu2+-induced A\u03b2 neurotoxicity. Along with in vivo A\u03b2-binding and favorable BBB permeability properties, the treatment of transgenic 5xFAD mice with L1 significantly reduces the amount of both amyloid plaques and associated phosphorylated tau (p-tau) aggregates in the brain by 40\u201350% versus the vehicle-treated 5xFAD mice. Besides, L1 mitigates the neuroinflammatory response of the activated microglia during the A\u03b2-induced inflammation process. Overall, these results suggest that L1 not only efficiently attenuates the formation of amyloid plaques and p-tau aggregates in vivo, but also reduces the microgliamediated neuroinflammatory response, which is quite uncommon among the previously reported amyloid-targeting chemical agents, and thus L1 could be envisioned as a lead compound for the development of novel AD therapeutics.</div>", "date": "2019-12-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemical Biology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Here we describe a protocol for SEA ligation at pH 5.5 in the presence of 4-mercaptophenylacetic acid (MPAA) or at pH 4.0 in the presence of a newly developed diselenol catalyst. The protocols describe the formation of a valyl-cysteinyl peptide bond between two model peptides.<br />", "date": "2019-12-23", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Organocatalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Am. Chem. Soc. 2020, DOI: 10.1021/jacs.9b11715]. For the neutral [Co<sup>III</sup>(TAMLsq)] complex this leads to the doublet (S = \u00bd) mono-nitrene radical species [Co<sup>III</sup>(TAMLq)(N<sup>\u2022</sup>Ns)], while a triplet (S = 1) bis-nitrene radical species [Co<sup>III</sup>(TAML<sup>q</sup>)(N<sup>\u2022</sup>Ns)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>\u2012</sup> is generated from the anionic [Co<sup>III</sup>(TAML<sup>red</sup>)]<sup>\u2012</sup> complex. The one-electron reduced Fischer-type nitrene radicals (N<sup>\u2022</sup>Ns<sup>\u2012</sup>) are formed through single (mono-nitrene) or double (bis-nitrene) ligand-to-substrate single-electron transfer (SET). In this work we describe the reactivity and mechanisms of these nitrene radical complexes in catalytic aziridination. We report that [Co<sup>III</sup>(TAML<sup>sq</sup>)] and [Co<sup>III</sup>(TAML<sup>red</sup>)]<sup>\u2012</sup> are both effective catalysts for chemoselective (C=C versus C\u2012H bonds) and diastereoselective aziridination of styrene derivatives, cyclohexene and 1-hexene under mild and even aerobic (for [Co<sup>III</sup>(TAML<sup>red</sup>)]<sup>\u2012</sup>) conditions.

Surprisingly, the electrophilic one-electron reduced Fischer-type nitrene radicals do not react as would be expected for nitrene radicals (i.e. via radical addition and radical rebound). Instead, nitrene transfer proceeds through unusual electronically asynchronous transition states, in which (partial) styrene substrate to TAML ligand (single) electron transfer precedes C-N coupling. The actual C-N bond formation processes are best described as involving a nucleophilic attack of the nitrene (radical) lone pair at the thus (partially) formed styrene radical cation. These processes are coupled to TAML-to-cobalt and cobalt-to-nitrene single-electron transfer, effectively leading to formation of an amido-[gamma]-benzyl radical (Ns\u2013N\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>\u2013<sup>\u2022</sup>CH\u2013Ph) bound to an intermediate spin (S = 1) cobalt(III) center. Hence, the TAML moiety can be regarded to act as a transient electron acceptor, the cobalt center behaves as a spin shuttle and the nitrene radical acts as a nucleophile.

Although molecular simulation has demonstrated its capability of predicting mixture vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) behaviors, including azeotropes, its potential for mechanistic investigation has not been fully exploited. In this study, we use the united atom transferable potentials for phase equilibria (TraPPE-UA) force-field to model the ethanol/benzene mixture, which displays a positive azeotrope. Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) simulation is performed to predict the VLE phase diagram, including an azeotrope point. The results accurately agree with experimental measurements. We argue that the molecular mechanism of azeotrope formation cannot be fully understood by studying the mixture liquid-state stability at the azeotrope point alone. Rather, azeotrope occurrence is only a reflection of the changing relative volatility between the two components over a much wider composition range. A thermodynamic criterion is thus proposed based on the comparison of partial excess Gibbs energy between the components. In the ethanol/benzene system, molecular energetics shows that with increasing ethanol mole fraction, its volatility initially decreases but later plateaus, while benzene volatility is initially nearly constant and only starts to decrease when its mole fraction is low. Analysis of the mixture liquid structure, including a detailed investigation of ethanol hydrogen-bonding configurations at different composition levels, reveals the underlying molecular mechanism for the changing volatilities responsible for the azeotrope.", "date": "2019-12-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Physical and Chemical Properties; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Six different transfer learning models were developed with different subsets of the donor-acceptor database as training sets.

In particular, the possibility of tuning the band gap in AB-stacked BLG (AB-BLG) has a great technological importance for electronic and optoelectronics applications. Most of current methods to produce AB-BLG suffer from inhomogeneous layer thickness and/or coexistence with twisted BLG. Here, we demonstrate a method to synthesise highly pure large-area AB-BLG by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) using Cu-Ni films. Increasing the reaction time resulted in a gradual increase of the AB stacking, with the BLG eventually free from twist regions for the longer times (99.4 % of BLG has AB stacking), due to catalyst-assisted continuous BLG reconstruction driven by carbon dissolution-segregation processes. The band gap opening was confirmed by the electrical measurements.

Here we use molecular simulations to characterize the wettability of the 10.4-face of calcite in a calcite/brine/oil system, and address how wettability is altered by changing ionic strength and salt type (NaCl vs. CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Using the test area method we calculate the superficial tension of the fluids against the solid and the surface tension between the two fluid phases. As the salinity is decreased, the wetting of calcite by brine is progressively less favored, contrary to what might be expected based on low salinity flooding.

On balance, it is the latter effect that leads to the enhanced wetting of calcite by brine in the oil-brine-calcite system, and it is suggested as an important element in the physics underlying low-salinity flooding.  <br />", "date": "1970-01-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Fuels - Energy Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Curved glass-polymer interfaces are prepared by SP functionalization of E-glass fibers, which are subsequently embedded in a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix.

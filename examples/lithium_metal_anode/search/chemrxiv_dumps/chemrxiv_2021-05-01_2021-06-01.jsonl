For \nthis reason, the synthesis of dendritic polyurethanes is limited to very few reports. With primary focus of dendrimer research on the \ninteraction of the periphery and the core, we report the synthesis of a common polyurethane dendron, which allows for late-stage \nvariation of both the periphery and the core. The periphery can be varied simply by installing a clickable unit in the dendron and then \nattaching to the core and vice-versa. Thus, a common dendron allows for varying periphery and core in just two steps. To accomplish \nthis, protecting group free one-pot multicomponent Curtius reaction was utilized to afford a robust and versatile AB2 type \npolyurethane dendron employing commercially available simple molecules 5-hydroxyisophthalic acid, 11-bromoundecanol, and 4-\npenten-1-ol. Subsequent late-stage modification of either dendrons or dendrimers via thiol-ene click reaction gave surface?functionalized alternating aromatic-aliphatic polyurethane homodendrimers to generation-three (G3). The dendrons and the \ndendrimers were characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, and FT-IR analysis. A bifunctional AB2 type dendritic monomer \ndemonstrated this approach's versatility that can either undergo a thiol-one click or attachment to the core. This approach enables the \nincorporation of functionalities at the periphery and the core that may not withstand the dendrimer growth for the synthesis of \npolyurethane dendrimers and other dendritic macromolecules", "date": "2021-05-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Synthesis and Reactions", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Furthermore, in multifunctional fibers, significant volume is occupied by passive polymer cladding that so far has only served structural or electrical insulation purposes. In this letter, we report a rapid, robust, and modular approach to creating multi-functional fiber-based neural interfaces using a solvent evaporation or entrapment driven (SEED) integration process.

The main caveat to binary classification approaches is that they weight minority cases close to the threshold boundary equivalently in distinguishing between activity classes. For example, a pXC50 activity value of 5.1 or 4.9 are treated equally important in contributing to the opposing activity (e.g., classification threshold of 5), even though experimental error may not afford such discriminatory accuracy. This is detrimental in practice and therefore it is equally important to evaluate the presence of experimental error in databases and apply methodologies to account for variability in experiments and uncertainty near the decision boundary.<br /></p><p></p><p> </p><p>In order to improve upon this, we herein present a novel approach toward predicting protein-ligand interactions using a Probabilistic Random Forest (PRF) classifier. The PRF comprises a modification to the long-established Random Forest (RF), to take into account uncertainties in the assigned classes (i.e., activity labels). This enables representing the activity in a framework in-between the classification and regression architecture, with philosophical differences from either approach. Compared to classification, this approach enables better representation of factors increasing/decreasing inactivity. Conversely, one can utilize all data (even delimited/operand/censored data far from a cut-off) at the same time as taking into account the granularity around the cut-off, compared to a classical regression framework. The algorithm was applied toward ~550 target prediction tasks from ChEMBL and PubChem. The largest benefit in incorporating the experimental deviation in PRF was observed for data points close to the binary threshold boundary, when such information is not considered in any way in the original RF algorithm. In comparison, the baseline RF outperformed PRF for cases with high confidence to belong to the active class (far from the binary decision threshold). The RF models gave errors smaller than the experimental uncertainty, which could indicate that they are <i>overtrained</i> and/or <i>over-confident</i>. Overall, we show that PRF can be useful for target prediction models in particular for data where class boundaries overlap with the measurement uncertainty, and where a substantial part of the training data is located close to the classification threshold. With this approach, we present, to our knowledge, for the first time an application of probabilistic modelling of activity data for target prediction using the PRF algorithm.</p>", "date": "2021-05-07", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The molybdate oxyanion is more\ndifficult to incorporate in the calcite bulk than the smaller sulphate oxyanion.\nHowever, when molybdate is substituted at the surface, the elastic cost is\navoided because the oxyanion protrudes out of the surface and gains stability\nvia the interaction with water at the interface, which in balance results in\nmore favourable surface substitution for molybdate than for sulphate.

The discovery of this phenomenon has ensued a quest for new materials that are able to effectively take advantage of this mechanism. From a theoretical standpoint, this requires the capacity to estimate the rates of the various processes involved in the photophysics of candidate molecules, such as intersystem crossing, reverse intersystem crossing, fluorescence and phosphorescence. Here we present a method that is able to, within a single framework, compute all these rates and predict the photophysics of new molecules.

Using the aqueous system as a bridge between the unconfined vacuum system and a constricting protein scaffold, we investigate the steric and electronic effects of the environment on the photodynamical behavior of the chromophore. Specifically, we perform <i>ab initio </i>multiple spawning to simulate five picoseconds of nonadiabatic dynamics after photoexcitation, resolving the excited-state pathways responsible for internal conversion in the aqueous chromophore. We identify an ultrafast pathway that proceeds through a short-lived (sub-picosecond) imidazolinone-twisted (I-twisted) species and a slower (several picoseconds) channel that proceeds through a long-lived phenolate-twisted (P-twisted) intermediate. The molecule navigates the non-equilibrium energy landscape via an aborted hula-twist-like motion towards the one-bond-flip dominated conical intersection seams, as opposed to following the pure one-bond-flip paths proposed by the excited-state equilibrium picture. We interpret our simulations in the context of time-resolved fluorescence experiments, which use short and long time components to describe the fluorescence decay of the aqueous GFP chromophore. Our results suggest that the longer time component is caused by an energetically uphill approach to the P-twisted intersection seam rather than an excited-state barrier to reach the twisted intramolecular charge transfer species. Irrespective of the location of the non-adiabatic population events, the twisted intersection seams are inefficient at facilitating isomerization in aqueous solution. The disordered and homogeneous nature of the aqueous solvent environment facilitates non-selective stabilization with respect to I- and P-twisted species, offering an important foundation for understanding the consequences of selective stabilization in heterogeneous and rigid protein environments.", "date": "2021-05-10", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Quantum Mechanics; Solution Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The full implementation of greener biodiesel is often deemed an infeasible method for mitigating pollution because the production of such biodiesel directly competes with the agricultural industry for the available arable land. Energy-dense algae are more suitable feedstocks for biodiesel and circumvent many of the problems posed by current biodiesel feedstocks, and their potential can be used to propel the biodiesel industry into the future of sustainable energy. Nannochloropsis is a promising genus of algae due to its high productivity and lipid content. Here I show how to optimize the growing medium composition for increased biodiesel quality while maintaining high productivity by quantifying the constituent fatty acid type and composition using gas chromatography (GC). The algae are grown in two groups of three 2.5 L glass jugs spanning three concentration levels of nitrates and phosphates. A growing \u201cf/2\u201d medium is kept constant across trials. The algae are harvested using a flocculating solution of aluminum sulfate and vacuum filtration. In situ transesterification is used to achieve maximum conversion of fatty acids into fatty acid methyl esters, which are then analyzed using GC. The algae grown in low, medium, and high nutrient concentrations produced average absorbance values (a measure of biomass concentration) at 750 nm of 0.91, 0.99, and 1.18, respectively, after 32 days of growth. The maximum monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) concentration of 62.68% of total fatty acids was reached in a low nutrient concentration, which corresponds to high-quality biodiesel.

These relationships are a simple, computationally efficient way to estimate adsorption energies by scaling the energy of a calculated surface species on one metal to any other metal. By conducting simulations with sensitivity analyses, users can not only determine the rate limiting step on each surface by plotting a \"volcano surface\" for the degree of rate control of each reaction as a function of elemental binding energies, but also screen novel catalysts for desirable properties. We investigated the catalytic partial oxidation of methane to demonstrate the utility of this new tool and determined that an inlet gas C/O ratio of 0.8 on a catalyst with carbon and oxygen binding energies of -6.75 eV and -5.0 eV, respectively, yields the highest amount of synthesis gas. Sensitivity analyses show that while the dissociative adsorption of O<sub>2</sub> has the highest degree of rate control, the interactions between individual reactions and reactor conditions are complex, which result in a dynamic rate-limiting step across differing metals.</div>", "date": "2021-05-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Reaction Engineering; Heterogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Bulk photoelectrochemical measurements demonstrate that PSI remains functional in a wide sample potential range around 0 mV/SSC. Electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ECSTM) imaging of individual complexes shows lateral sizes in agreement with the dimensions of PSI and an apparent height that is gated by the probe potential of ECTSM as reported for smaller globular redox proteins.

Our novel design robustly traps <i>Escherichia coli</i> at a flow rate of 10 \u00b5L minute<sup>-1</sup> and has a cell recovery performance of 47 \u00b1 3 % after washing the trapped cells.<br />To verify that the performance of the medium exchange device is sufficient, we tested the electrocompetence of the recovered cells in a standard transformation procedure and found a transformation efficiency of 8\u221910<sup>5</sup> CFU per \u00b5g of plasmid DNA. Our device is a viable low-volume alternative to centrifugation-based methods and opens the door for miniaturization of a plethora of microbiological and molecular engineering protocols.<br />", "date": "2021-05-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Microbiology", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0"}

Given the many candidate materials, choosing the right combination of materials to be used in an array is a challenging task. In a sensor whose sensing mechanism depends on a change in mass upon gas adsorption, both the equilibrium and kinetic characteristics of the gas-material system dictate the performance of the array. The overarching goal of this work is two-fold. First, we aim to highlight the impact of thermodynamic characteristics of gas-material combination on array performance and to develop a graphical approach to rapidly screen materials. Second, we aim to highlight the need to incorporate the gas sorption kinetic characteristics to provide an accurate picture of the performance of a sensor array. To address these goals, we have developed a computational test bench that incorporates a sensor model and a gas composition estimator. To provide a generic study, we have chosen, as candidate materials, hypothetical materials that exhibit equilibrium characteristics similar to metal organic frameworks (MOFs). Our computational studies led to key learnings, namely: (1) exploit the shape of the sensor response as a function of gas composition for material screening purposes for gravimetric arrays; (2) incorporate both equilibrium and kinetics for gas composition estimation in a dynamic system; and (3) engineer the array by accounting for the kinetics of the materials, the feed gas flow rate, and the size of the device.", "date": "2021-05-13", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Sensors", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

These so-called ion-pi interactions play a major role in enzymes, molecular recognition, and for the structure of proteins. In this work, a molecular test set termed IONPI19 is compiled for inter- and intramolecular ion-pi interactions, which is well balanced between anionic and cationic systems. The IONPI19 set includes interaction energies of significantly larger molecules (up to 133 atoms) than in other ion-pi test sets and covers a broad range of binding motifs. Accurate (local) coupled cluster values are provided as reference. Overall, 18 density functional approximations, including seven (meta-)GGAs, seven hybrid functionals, and four double hybrid functionals combined with three different London dispersion corrections, are benchmarked for interaction energies. DFT results are further compared to wave function based methods such as MP2 and dispersion corrected Hartree-Fock. Also the performance</p><p>of semiempirical QM methods such as the GFNn-xTB and PMx family of methods is tested. It is shown that dispersion-uncorrected DFT underestimates ion-pi interactions significantly, even though electrostatic interactions dominate the overall binding. Accordingly, the new charge dependent D4 dispersion model is found to be consistently better than the standard D3 correction. Furthermore, the functional performance trend along Jacob\u2019s ladder is generally obeyed and the reduction of the self-interaction error leads to an improvement of (double) hybrid functionals over (meta-)GGAs, even though the effect of the SIE is smaller than expected. Overall, the double hybrids PWPB95-D4/QZ and revDSD-PBEP86-D4/QZ turned out to be the most reliable among all assessed methods in predicting ion-pi interactions, which opens up new perspectives for systems where coupled cluster calculations are no longer computationally feasible.</p>", "date": "2021-05-03", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The SARS-CoV-2 S protein on the membrane of infected cells can initiate receptor-dependent syncytia formation. To study the membrane fusion on S protein, we adopted structural domain search methods to analyze the structural and non-structural proteins of the SARS-COV-2 virus in this study. The results showed that the surface glycoprotein (S) had conserved domains of CaMKII: CaMKII_AD, CaATP_NAI, DUF4440, EF-hand, Protein kinase, and SnoaL-like. Comparing to SARS-COV and MERS, only the CaATP_NAI of SARS-COV-2 is in the contact position of the viral membrane and cell membrane. We believed that when the EF-hand domain (\u201cYEQYIKWPWYIWLGF\u201d) of S protein bound to calcium ions, S2 protein had CaMKII protein activities. After the S protein fusion peptide was inserted into the infected cell membrane and fixed the S2 protein on the cell membrane, the CaMKII_AD prompted the S2 protein to form HR1-HR2 six-helix bundles. The HR1-HR2 hexamer had three CaATP_NAI domains (\u201cAPAICHDGKAHFPRE\u201d) near the viral membrane (contact position), the CaATPase activated by magnesium ions, and released energy through ATP phosphorylation. The CaATPase drove the HR1-HR2 hexamer fold irreversibly toward the viral membrane. Then the CaATP_NAI and CaMKII_AD domains extended to the outside and combined the viral membrane and the cell membrane so that the contact position formed a thin barrel structure. The hydrated calcium ions are gathered in the barrel structure to create a calcium bridge. The release action of water in contact position caused the instability of the double membrane, triggering lipid mixing and fusion of the membrane. CaATPases disassembled the barrel structure, and HR1-HR2 hexamer is fell into the cytoplasm. The viral membrane fused with the cell membrane on a large scale. The cytoplasmic contents of the virus mixed with the cell.

This report started when an apparent lack of data in the literature led us to revisit the fundamental photophysics of europium(iii). The photophysical properties of two complexes \u2013 [Eu.DOTA(MeOH-d4)]- and [Eu(MeOH-d4)9]3+ \u2013 were investigated in deuterated methanol at five different temperatures. Absorption spectra showed decreased absorption cross sections as the temperature was increased. Luminescence spectra and time-resolved emission decay profiles showed a decrease in intensity and lifetime as a temperature was increased. Having corrected the emission spectra for the actual number of absorbed photons and differences in non-radiative pathways, the relative emission probability was revealed. These were found to increase with increasing temperature. The transition probability for luminescence was shown to increase with temperature, while the transition probability for light absorption decreased. The changes in transition probabilities were correlated to a change in the symmetry of the absorber or emitter, with an average increase in symmetry lowering absorption cross section and access to more asymmetric structures increasing the emission rate constant. Determining luminescence quantum yields and the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission allowed us to conclude that lowering symmetry increases both. Further, it was found that collisional self-quenching is an issue for lanthanide luminescence, when high concentrations are used. Finally, detailed analysis revealed results that show the so-called \u2018Werts\u2019 method\u2019 for calculating radiative lifetimes and intrinsic quantum yields are based on assumption that does not hold for the two systems investigated here.

It was therefore the aim of the present study to compare liposomal formulations with identical composition, which were prepared using either extrusion or microfluidics protocols. Liposomal formulations produced by both methods were analyzed using dynamic light scattering (DLS) to compare size, polydispersity, and \u03b6-potential. Our results indicate significant differences between liposomal preparations obtained using the two manufacturing methods. We conclude that the two preparation methods should not be used interchangeably.<br />", "date": "2021-05-19", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Lack of knowledge of the atomic-level structure limits understanding of its function and exploitation of its potential in material science. To overcome these limitations, we present a systematic density functional theory study of the stability and optical properties of a library of 830 dimers of 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI), which are minimal models of eumelanin oligomers. Our aim is to understand the principles that govern the formation of DHI oligomers, relate the optical properties of the dimers with their stability, and establish their possible role in the photophysics of the biopolymer. From the structural point of view, we find a preference for oxidized over reduced and cyclic over linear structures, which speaks in favor of polycyclic graphite-like structures for the larger oligomers. We present an electrocyclization mechanism leading to the cyclic structures. We also find that besides the widely considered quinone and quinone methide oxidation patterns where two heteroatoms per DHI fragment are oxidized, dimers with one or three oxidized sites per fragment and an interfragment double bond  are also stable and may be present in eumelanin. As far as the optical properties are concerned, some oxidized dimers combine relative stability with absorption energies as low as 1.3 eV. Such fragments may be present as substructures in the naturally found oligomers and might have a relevant contribution to the absorption spectrum of the biopolymer. In addition to these insights into the struc-tural and optical properties of the oligomers, we introduce a new classification scheme and a representative set of 53 dimers combining thermodynamic stability with chemical diversity.<br />", "date": "2021-05-11", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The extreme-pressure polarizable continuum model (XP-PCM) is an emerging method with an efficient quantum mechanical description of small and medium-size molecules at high pressure (on the order of GPa). However, its application to large molecular systems was previously hampered by CPU computation bottleneck: the Pauli repulsion potential unique to XP-PCM requires the evaluation of a large number of electric field integrals, resulting in significant computational overhead compared to the gas-phase or standard-pressure polarizable continuum model calculations. Here, we exploit advances in Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate the XP-PCM integral evaluations. This enables high-pressure quantum chemistry simulation of proteins that used to be computationally intractable. We benchmarked the performance using 18 small proteins in aqueous solutions. Using a single GPU, our method evaluates the XP-PCM free energy of a protein with over 500 atoms and 4000 basis functions within half an hour. The time taken by the XP-PCM-integral evaluation is typically 1\\% of the time taken for a gas-phase density functional theory (DFT) on the same system. The overall XP-PCM calculations require less computational effort than that for their gas-phase counterpart due to the improved convergence of self-consistent field iterations. Therefore, the description of the high-pressure effects with our GPU accelerated XP-PCM is feasible for any molecule tractable for gas-phase DFT calculation.

Inverted opals made of high-refractive index semiconductors have attracted great attention due to their supreme optical features such as the occurrence of a photonic band-gap and because of an astonishing behavior in photocatalysis or for photovoltaics caused by so-called slow photons. It is much less known that photonic glasses, despite being disordered, exhibit unique optical properties too like random lasing or high-contrast structural colors. In analogy to opals and inverted opals, one can expect that inverted colloidal glasses may lead to an amplification of photonic properties as well or even to the emergence of unexpected features. An inverted photonic glass is characterized by a dense packing of monodisperse voids with colloidal dimensions without any long-range order. The preparation of inverse photonic glasses has rarely been reported by now and cases for materials composed of a semiconductor as a pore-wall material are unknown. The synthesis of porous carbon nitride (C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) with inverted colloidal glass structure is demonstrated here using a template approach. The formation of the template with glass-like order is achieved by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUZ) of size-selected silica colloids, followed by infiltration of a precursor sol, transformation to carbon nitride and the final removal of the template. The use of AUZ is particularly important because it even allows to use a mixture of differently sized template particles, which are gradually fractionated. Monoliths with optimized morphological features exhibiting a gradient porosity and highly accessible pores are obtained.  The result are materials with a graded structure. What makes such functional gradient material interesting is, a dependence of the optical features on the position can be expected. In addition, the method presented here allows to synthesize materials with adjustable composition ranging from carbon over nitrogen-doped carbon to C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> with either graphitic or polymeric structure. Therefore, the optical band gap is highly adjustable and tunable with regards to the photonic properties, as confirmed by optical absorption and photoluminescence measurements.", "date": "2021-05-21", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Plasmonic and Photonic Structures and Devices", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Although a typical technology in practical use is the deposition of metal or inorganic materials between multilayer films to reduce the oxygen transmission rate, once the film is damaged, oxygen permeates through the damaged area, damaging the packaged food. In addition, nanobrick wall structures consisting of nanoplatelet bricks have the potential to replace barrier films made of inorganic materials, however, they similarly lack repair performance or have slow repair speed despite having repair performance. Inspired by the rapid self-repair mechanism of cephalopods, the study develops a nanoclay-containing coating that can rapidly repair surface damage via water. By introducing CaCl<sub>2</sub>-derived counterions and montmorillonite for nanobrick wall structures into polyelectrolyte multilayers stacked by layer-by-layer self-assembly, the non-covalent polymer network is increased, resulting in mimicking a strong cephalopod-derived \u03b2-sheet structure and non-covalent intermolecular interactions derived from cephalopods. Regardless of the amount of montmorillonite added, the self-healing process was completed within 10 sec. The high-water retention at the surface showed super-bubble-phobicity in water and inhibited gas permeation. The oxygen permeability of the coatings with more than a certain amount of montmorillonite was less than 1/100 of that of bare polyethylene. The ultra-fast self-healing gas barrier coating has the potential to be used not only for food products but also for electronics and pharmaceutical packaging and gas separation applications.

Unfortunately, lithium suffers from significant drawbacks as a drug, mainly a narrow therapeutic window. Among the different targets of lithium, glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) might be the one responsible for its therapeutic effects. Developing alternative, selective inhibitors of this kinase could avoid lithium side effects, but efforts to do so have met little success so far. A detailed, atomistic understanding of Li+ inhibition and a more detailed understanding of the phosphorylation reaction GSK-3\u03b2 catalyzes would therefore facilitate the development of new drugs. In this study, we use extensive sampling of catalytic states with our mixed quantum-classical dynamics method QM/DMD and binding affinities from a competitive metal affinity (CMA) approach to fill out the atomic scale picture of Li+ GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition. We compare Li+ action with Be2+, another known inhibitor, and find our results in agreement with in-vitro kinetics studies. Ultimately, our simulations show that Li+ inhibition is driven primarily by directly decreasing the reaction rate of the phosphorylation step, rather than reducing catalytic turnover through tight binding to different GSK-3\u03b2 states like Be2+ inhibition. The effect of these metals derive from electrostatic differences and especially their smaller atomic radii compared to the native Mg2+ and thus provides insight for the development of GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitors based on other paradigms.</div>", "date": "2021-05-24", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Biochemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In this paradigm, quantum chemistry acts as a relatively cost-effective oracle for evaluating the properties of particular molecules while generative models provide a means of sampling chemical space based on learned structure-function relationships. For practical applications, multiple potentially orthogonal properties must be optimized in tandem during a discovery workflow. This carries additional difficulties associated with specificity of the targets and the ability for the model to reconcile all properties simultaneously. Here we demonstrate an active learning approach to improve the performance of multi-target generative chemical models. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of a set of baseline models trained on single property prediction tasks in generating novel compounds with various property targets, including both interpolative and extrapolative generation scenarios. For property ranges where accurate targeting proves difficult, the novel compounds suggested by the model are characterized using quantum chemistry to obtain the true values, and these new molecules closest to expressing the desired properties are fed back into the generative model for additional training. This gradually improves the generative models\u2019 understanding of unknown areas of chemical space and shifts the distribution of generated compounds towards the targeted values. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of this active learning approach in generating compounds with multiple chemical constraints, including vertical ionization potential, electron affinity, and dipole moment targets, and validate the results at the \uf077B97X-D3/def2-TZVP level.

Thereby, the efficiency of sample preparation, i.e., protein isolation, solubilization and proteolysis, directly affects the correctness and reliability of quantification, being therefore the bottle neck of shotgun proteomics. The desired performance of the sample preparation protocols can be achieved by application of detergents. However, these ultimately compromise reverse phase chromatographic separation and disrupt electrospray ionization. Filter aided sample preparation (FASP) represents an elegant approach to overcome these limitations. Although this method is comprehensively validated for cell proteomics, its applicability to plants and compatibility with plant-specific protein isolation protocols is still unknown, i.e., no data on linearity of underlying protein quantification methods for plant matrices is available. To fill this gap, we address here the potential of FASP in combination with two protein isolation protocols for quantitative analysis of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) seed and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> leaf proteomes by the shotgun approach. For this, in comprehensive spiking experiments with bovine serum albumin (BSA), we evaluated the linear dynamic range (LDR) of protein quantification in the presence of plant matrices. Further, we addressed the interference of two different plant matrices in quantitative experiments, accomplished with two alternative sample preparation workflows in comparison to conventional FASP-based digestion of cell lysates, considered here as a reference.

Nevertheless, we combined experimental water-vapor adsorption with first principles simulations to identify the mechanism of germanosilicate zeolite disassembly. The results showed that water vapor adsorption on <b>UTL</b> germanosilicate proceeds in reversible (at low partial pressures) and irreversible (at higher partial pressures) modes.

The transient response of those reactions is influenced by effects on different length scales, ranging from the active surface via the individual porous catalyst particle up to the full-scale reactor. The challenge, however, is to characterize unsteady-state effects under realistic operation conditions and to assign them to distinct transport processes. Therefore, the periodic transient kinetics (PTK) method is introduced, which allows for the separation of kinetic process dynamics at different length scales experimentally under realistic operation conditions. The methodology also provides the capability for statistical analysis of the experimental results and therefore improved reliability of the derived conclusions. Therefore, the PTK method provides the experimental basis for model-based derivation of reaction kinetics valid under dynamic conditions.

SQ109 is metabolized by the liver, and it has been proposed that some of its metabolites might be responsible for its activity against TB. Here, we synthesized six potential P450 metabolites of SQ109 and used these as well as 10 other likely metabolites as standards in a mass spectrometry study of <i>M. tuberculosis</i>-infected rabbits treated with SQ109, in addition to testing all 16 putative metabolites for anti-bacterial activity. We found that there were just two major metabolites in lung tissue: a hydroxy-adamantyl analog of SQ109 and N\u2019-adamantylethylenediamine. Neither of these, or the other potential metabolites tested, inhibited the growth of <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, or of <i>M. smegmatis</i>, <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> or <i>E. coli</i>, making it unlikely that an SQ109 metabolite contributes to its anti-bacterial activity. In the rabbit TB model, it is thus the gradual accumulation of non-metabolized SQ109 in tissues to therapeutic levels that leads to good efficacy. Our results also provide new insights into how SQ109 binds to its target MmpL3, based on our mass spectroscopy results which indicate that the charge in SQ109 is primarily localized on the geranyl nitrogen, explaining the very short distance to a key Asp found in the X-ray structure of SQ109 bound to MmpL3.

The majority of the work is on organic molecules, and much more work needs to be done for inorganic molecules, especially clusters. In the present work, we introduce a simple Topological Atomic Descriptor called TAD, which encodes chemical environment information of each atom in the cluster. TAD is a simple and interpretable descriptor where each value represents the atom count in three shells. We also introduce the DART, Deep Learning Enabled Topological Interaction model, which uses TAD as a feature vector to predict energies of metal clusters, in our case Gallium clusters with size ranging from 31 to 70 atoms. DART model is designed based on the principle that energy is a function of atomic interactions and allows us to model these complex atomic interactions to predict the energy. We further introduce a new dataset called GNC_31-70, which comprises structures and DFT optimized energies of Gallium clusters with sizes ranging from 31 to 70 atoms. We show how DART can be used to accelerate the identification of ground-state structures without geometry optimization. Albeit using topological descriptor, DART achieves MAE of 3.59 kcal/mol (0.15 eV) on testset. We also show that our model can distinguish core and surface atoms in the Ga-70 cluster, which the model has never encountered earlier. Finally, we demonstrate the transferability of DART model by predicting energies for about 6k unseen configurations picked up from Molecular Dynamics (MD) data for three cluster sizes (46, 57, and 60) within seconds.

Expanded ensemble (EE) methods, which involve single simulations visiting all of the alchemical intermediates, have some key advantages for alchemical free energy calculation. However, there have been relatively few examples published in the literature of using expanded ensemble simulations for free energies of protein-ligand binding. In this paper, as a test of expanded ensemble methods, we computed relative binding free energies using the Open Force Field Initiative force field (codename \u201cParsley\u201d) for twenty-four pairs of Tyk2 inhibitors derived from a congeneric series of 16 compounds. The EE predictions agree well with the experimental values (RMSE of 0.94 \u00b1 0.13 kcal mol<sup>\u22121</sup> and MUE of 0.75 \u00b1 0.12 kcal mol<sup>\u22121</sup>). We find that while increasing the number of alchemical intermediates can improve the phase space overlap, faster convergence can be obtained with fewer intermediates, as long as the acceptance rates are sufficient. We find that convergence can be improved using more aggressive updating of the biases, and that estimates can be improved by performing multiple independent EE calculations. This work demonstrates that EE is a viable option for alchemical free energy calculation. We discuss the implications of these findings for rational drug design, as well as future directions for improvement.</p>", "date": "2021-05-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Computational Chemistry and Modeling", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

MolGAN is a renowned molecular generation models that uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning to generate molecular graphs in one shot. MolGAN can effectively generate a small molecular graph with nine or fewer heavy atoms. However, the graphs tend to become disconnected as the molecular size increase. This poses a challenge to drug discovery and material design, where large molecules are potentially inclusive. This study develops an improved MolGAN for large molecule generation (L-MolGAN). In this model, the connectivity of molecular graphs is evaluated by a depth-first search during the model training process. When a disconnected molecular graph is generated, L-MolGAN rewards the graph a zero score. This procedure decreases the number of disconnected graphs, and consequently increases the number of connected molecular graphs. The effectiveness of L-MolGAN is experimentally evaluated. The size and connectivity of the molecular graphs generated with data from the ZINC-250k molecular dataset are confirmed using MolGAN as the baseline model. The model is then optimized for a quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED) to generate drug-like molecules. The experimental results indicate that the connectivity measure of generated molecular graphs improved by 1.96 compared with the baseline model at a larger maximum molecular size of 20 atoms. The molecules generated by L-MolGAN are evaluated in terms of multiple chemical properties, QED, synthetic accessibility, and log octanol\u2013water partition coefficient, which are important in drug design. This result confirms that L-MolGAN can generate various drug-like molecules despite being optimized for a single property, i.e., QED.

Currently, there are no pharmacological treatments proven against COVID-19 or that may be of a broad spectrum to minimize the sequelae. This work aims to identify compounds or drugs already commercialized that may be supporting in the treatment of infectious conditions of COVID-19, parallel to the administration of vaccines. In this context, molecular docking simulations were carried out to understand which drugs are most effective in modulating a total of ten receptors, whether directly in viral, pro-inflammatory or central nervous system signaling, related to COVID-19. Subsequently, some results were validated through molecular dynamics simulations based on publicly available trajectory files. Among a total of 71 molecular docking simulations, the drug ledipasvir administered to patients with Hepatitis-C (HCV) was the most promising with a mean value \u0394G\u00ba \u2248 -10.3 kcal \u00b7 mol<sup>-1</sup> and a nonspecific probability according to neural networks of 0.21. Ivermectin, although it had an average affinity of -9.6  kcal \u00b7 mol<sup>-1</sup>, was shown to be a ligand with a very expressive degree of nonspecificity of 0.93. When analyzing the atomic fluctuations of molecular dynamics, telaprevir stood out for the large number of rotational freedom in line with expressive RMSF fluctuations with a peak around 20 \u00c5 in the interaction with the Spike protein. Consequently, it was shown to be superior to the various anecdotally reported medications, such as nitazoxanide, and that due to the low mobility, the affinity was not so expressive due to the relative high fluctuations of 10 \u00c5.

Here we show that Rh-catalysts supported by a tetrafluorobenzobarrelene ligand (Ph-tfb) enable the enantio-, diastereo-, and Z-selective a,d-difunctionalization of electron-deficient 1,3-dienes with organoboronic acid nucleophiles and aldehyde electrophiles to generate Z-homoallylic alcohols with three stereocenters. The reaction accommodates diene substrates activated by ester, amide, ketone, or aromatic groups and can be used to couple aryl, alkenyl, or alkyl aldehydes. Diastereoselective functionalization of the Z-olefin unit in the addition products allow for the generation of compounds with five stereocenters in high dr and ee. Mechanistic studies suggest aldehyde allylrhodation is the rate determining step, and unlike reactions of analogous Rh-enolates, the Rh-allyl species generated by d-arylation undergoes aldehyde trapping rather than protonolysis, even when water is present as a co-solvent.

Even though considerable advances have been achieved in recent years, the field of generative molecular design is still in its infancy. One potential solution may be to integrate domain knowledge of structural or medicinal chemistry into the data-driven machine learning process to address specific deep molecule generation goals. This manuscript proposes a new graph-based hierarchical variational autoencoder (VAE) model for molecular generation. Training molecules are first decomposed into small molecular fragments. Unlike other motif-based molecular graph generative models, we further group decomposed fragments into different interchangeable fragment clusters according to their local structural environment around the attachment points where the bond-breaking occurs. In this way, each chemical structure can be transformed into a three-layer graph, in which individual atoms, decomposed fragments, or obtained fragment clusters act as graph nodes at each corresponding layer, respectively. We construct a hierarchical VAE model to learn such three-layer hierarchical graph representations of chemical structures in a fine-to-coarse order, in which atoms, decomposed fragments, and related fragment clusters act as graph nodes at each corresponding graph layer. The decoder component is designed to iteratively select a fragment out of a predicted fragment cluster vocabulary and then attach it to the preceding substructure. The newly introduced third graph layer will allow us to incorporate specific chemical structural knowledge, e.g., interchangeable fragments sharing similar local chemical environments or bioisosteres derived from matched molecular pair analysis information, into the molecular generation process. It will increase the odds of assembling new chemical moieties absent in the original training set and enhance structural diversity/novelty scores of generated structures. Our proposed approach demonstrates comparatively good performance in terms of model efficiency and other molecular evaluation metrics when compared with several other graph- and SMILES-based generative molecular models. We also analyze how our generative models' performance varies when choosing different fragment sampling techniques and radius parameters that determine the local structural environment of interchangeable fragment clusters. Hopefully, our multi-level hierarchical VAE prototyping model might promote more sophisticated works of knowledge-augmented deep molecular generation in the future.", "date": "2021-05-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Hydrated hydroxide complexes embedded in the entangled polymer chain make big difference on the clustering of O atoms which dominates the AIE property of nonconjugated PMVEMA.

For Au- and Pd-catalyzed allylic diol cyclization, while the DFT potential energy surface landscapes show a stepwise sequence of alkoxylation \u03c0-addition, proton transfer, and water elimination, quasiclassical direct dynamics simulations reveal new dynamical mechanisms that depend on the metal center. For Au, trajectories reveal that after \u03c0-addition the Au-alkyl intermediate is always skipped because addition is dynamically coupled with proton transfer and water elimination. In contrast, for Pd catalysis, due to differences in the potential-energy landscape shape, only about half of trajectories show Pd-alkyl intermediate skipping. The other half of the trajectories show the traditional two-step mechanism with the intervening Pd-alkyl intermediate. Overall, this work reveals that interpretation of a DFT potential-energy landscape can be insufficient to understand catalytic intermediates and mechanisms and that atomic momenta through dynamics simulations is needed to determine if an intermediate is genuinely part of a catalytic cycle.<br />", "date": "2021-05-31", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational; Homogeneous Catalysis", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

An integrated experimental-theoretical approach combining co-located multi-microscopy, centered on scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), with Raman microscopy and field emission-scanning electron microscopy, together with rate theory and density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to address OS-ET kinetics of hexaamineruthenium (III/II) chloride, [Ru(NH3)6]3+/2+.

These experiments were performed on multiple types of complex\nsamples that included a mixture of 50 standards, as well as cell and plasma\nextracts. The dynamic range for Q-MRM quantitative analysis was comparable to triple\nquadrupole multiple reaction monitoring (QqQ-MRM) analyses at up to 5 orders of\nmagnitude with the cell and plasma extracts showing similar matrix effects\nacross both platforms. Amino acid and fatty acid measurements performed from\ncertified NIST 1950 plasma with isotopically labelled standards demonstrated Q-MRM\naccuracy in the range of 91-110% for the amino acids, 76-129% for the fatty\nacids, and good precision (coefficient of variation < 10%). In order to\nenhance specificity, a newly developed Correlated Ion Monitoring (CIM)\nalgorithm was designed to facilitate these analyses. CIM autonomously processes,\naligns, filters, and compiles multiple ions within one chromatogram enabling\nboth precursor and in-source fragment ions to be correlated within a single chromatogram,\nalso enabling the detection of co-eluting species based on precursor and\nfragment ion ratios. Q-MRM and CIM with single quadrupole instrumentation has\nbeen designed as an alternative to QqQ-MRM technology by correlating precursor\nand fragment ions to facilitate high sensitivity Q-MRM quantitative analysis on\nexisting instrumentation that are generally inexpensive, easy to operate, and\ntechnically less complex. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>@font-face\n\t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\";\n\tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;\n\tmso-font-charset:0;\n\tmso-generic-font-family:roman;\n\tmso-font-pitch:variable;\n\tmso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal\n\t{mso-style-unhide:no;\n\tmso-style-qformat:yes;\n\tmso-style-parent:\"\";\n\tmargin:0in;\n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan;\n\tfont-size:12.0pt;\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\n\tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}.MsoChpDefault\n\t{mso-style-type:export-only;\n\tmso-default-props:yes;\n\tfont-size:11.0pt;\n\tmso-ansi-font-size:11.0pt;\n\tmso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;\n\tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;\n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;\n\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;\n\tmso-fareast-font-family:DengXian;\n\tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;\n\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;\n\tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\n\tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;\n\tmso-fareast-language:ZH-CN;}.MsoPapDefault\n\t{mso-style-type:export-only;\n\tmargin-bottom:8.0pt;\n\tline-height:107%;}div.WordSection1\n\t{page:WordSection1;}</p>", "date": "2021-05-26", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Analytical Chemistry - General; Biochemical Analysis; Environmental Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Separation Science", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Lithium metal anodes are an important step in the development of high energy density batteries owing to the high theoretical specific capacity of lithium metal. However, most lithium metal battery research has used a conventional lithium-ion formation protocol; this is time consuming, costly and does not account for the different properties of the lithium metal electrode. Here, we have used a recently reported promising phosphonium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide ionic liquid electrolyte coupled with an NMC622 high areal capacity cathode (>3.5 mAh/cm2) to investigate the effect of cell formation rates. A faster formation protocol comprised of a pulsed 1.25C current decreased the formation time by 56 % and gave a 38 % greater capacity retention after 50 cycles when compared to formation at C/20. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements showed that the fast formation gave rise to a lower-resistance SEI. Column-like lithium deposits with reduced porous lithium domains between the particles were observed using scanning electron microscope imaging. To underline the excellent performance of these high energy-density cells, a 56 % greater stack specific energy was achieved compared to the analogous graphite-based lithium-ion cell chemistries. </p>", "date": "2021-06-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Energy Storage", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

The trinuclear compound crystallizes in a laminar structure in triclinic space group P. The crystal structure was determined using complex data treatment due to non-merohedric twinning. Experimental data sets were recorded with large redundancy and separated according to scattering domain in order to obtain a reliable structure, which revealed the configuration of the europium(III) sites. In first site, the europium(III) 1,4,7,10-tetrazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetate (Eu.DOTA) complex was found to adopt a capped twisted square antiprismatic (cTSAP) conformation, where a capping water molecule increased the coordination number of the europium(III) site to nine (CN = 9). In the second site, the cationic europium(III) ion was found to be coordinated by three water molecules and five oxy groups from neighboring [Eu(DOTA)(H2O)]- complexes. The coordination geometry of this site was found to be a compressed square antiprism (SAP), and the coordination number of the europium(III) ion was found to be eight (CN = 8).

Specifically, NPs were simulated with different hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers while carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were used to mimic surface and confinement effects of hydrophobic building blocks occurring in a soil environment. The hydrophobicity of CNTs was modified by introducing different hydrophobic and hydrophilic functional groups at their inner surfaces. The results show that hydrophobic polymers have a strong affinity to adsorb at the outer surface and to be captured inside the CNT. The accumulation within the CNT is even increased in presence of hydrophobic functional groups.

In the present study, the LASs were significantly sorbed onto the polyethersulfonate (PES) membrane, suggesting that the less sorptive polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane is suitable for application in the POCIS device.

This method could go beyond the existing frameworks under the harmonic approximation (HA) of the potential energy surface (PES) so that the anharmonic effect could be considered, which is of vital importance when the electronic energy gap is much larger than the vibrational frequency. We calculate the internal conversion (IC) rates in a two-mode model with Morse potential to investigate the validity of HA. We find that HA is unsatisfactory unless only the lowest several vibrational states of the lower electronic state are involved in the transition process when the adiabatic excitation energy is relatively low. As the excitation energy increases, HA first underestimates and then overestimates the IC rates when the excited state PES shifts towards the dissociative side of the ground state PES. On the contrary, HA slightly overestimates the IC rates when the excited state PES shifts towards the repulsive side. In both cases, higher temperature enlarges the error of HA. As a real example to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the method, we calculate the IC rates of azulene from $S_1$ to $S_0$ on the ab initio anharmonic PES approximated by 1-mode representation. The calculated IC rates of azulene under HA are consistent with the analytically exact results. The rates on anharmonic PES are 30%-40%  higher than the rates under HA.</div>", "date": "2021-05-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

In order to be further exploited in relevant biological applications, photoactivation under near infrared (NIR) irradiation is required. Such requirement can be met through opportune chemical modifications,and most notably by favoring two-photon absorption (TPA) probability. Herein, a general and efficient synthesis of a biomimetic 2,6-g-pyrone analogue of cyclocurcumin is described, motivated by the fact that molecular modeling previews an order of magnitude increase of the NIR TPA cross-section for the latter compared to the natural counterpart. Three retrosynthetic pathways have been identified (i) via an aryl-oxazole intermediate or via an aryl-diynone through (ii) a bottom-up or (iii) a top-down approach. While avoiding the passage through unstable synthons or low yield intermediate reactions, only the latest approach could conveniently afford the 2,6-g-pyrone analogue of cyclocurcumin, in ten steps and with an overall yield of 18%. The photophysical properties of our biomimetic analogue have also been characterized showing an improved photo-isomerization yield over the parent natural compound. The potentially improved non-linear optical properties, as well an enhanced stability, may be correlated to the enforcement of the planarity of the pyrone moiety leading to a quadrupolar D-p-A-p-D system.<br />", "date": "2021-05-28", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Photochemistry (Org.)", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Compared to studies on temperature effects, studies of the pressure dependence of protein dynamic are rather limited. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with fine-tuned force fields (FFs) offer a powerful tool to explore the influence of thermodynamic conditions on proteins. Here we evaluate the transferability of the CHARMM36m (C36m) protein force field at varied pressures compared with NMR data using ubiquitin as a model protein. The pressure dependences of J couplings for hydrogen bonds and order parameters for internal motion are in good agreement with experiment. We demonstrate that the C36m FF combined with the LJ-PME method is suitable for simulations in a wide range of temperature and pressure. As the ubiquitin remains stable up to 2500 bar, we identify the mobility and stability of different hydrogen bonds in response to pressure. Based on those results, C36m is expected to be applied to more proteins in the future to further investigate protein dynamics under elevated pressures.</p>", "date": "2021-06-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

Conventionally, the many-body expansion is performed for the total energy, but such an energy-based many-body expansion often suffers from a slow convergence with respect to the expansion order. For systems that show strong polarization effects such as water clusters, this can render the energy-based many-body expansion infeasible. Here, we establish a density-based many-body expansion as a promising alternative approach. By performing the many-body expansion for the electron density instead of the total energy and inserting the resulting total electron density into the total energy functional of density-functional theory, one can derive a density-based energy correction, which in principle accounts for all higher order polarization effects. Here, we systematically assess the accuracy of such a density-based many-body expansion for test sets of water clusters. We show that already a density-based two-body expansion is able to reproduce interaction energies per fragment within chemical accuracy, and is able to accurately predict the energetic ordering as well as the relative interaction energies of different isomers of water clusters.</div>", "date": "2021-06-01", "journal": "chemRxiv", "categories": "Theory - Computational", "metrics": null, "license": "CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

While advances were made regarding their implementation in practical devices, debate exists regarding the physical origin for the delayed water reduction occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Evidently, one difficulty resides in our lack of knowledge regarding ions activity arising from this novel class of electrolyte, it being necessary to estimate the Nernst potential of associated redox reactions such as Li<sup>+</sup> intercalation or the hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, we first measured the potential shift of electrodes selective to either Li<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions from diluted to highly concentrated regimes in LiCl or LiTFSI solutions. Observing similar shifts for these different cations and environments, we establish that shifts in redox potentials from diluted to highly concentrated regime originates in large from an increase junction potential, it being dependent on the ions activity coefficients that increase with concentration. While our study shows that single ion activity coefficients, unlike mean ion activity coefficients, cannot be captured by any electrochemical means, we demonstrate that protons concentration increases by approximatively two orders of magnitude from 1 mol.kg<sup>-1</sup> to 15-20 mol.kg<sup>-1</sup> solutions.

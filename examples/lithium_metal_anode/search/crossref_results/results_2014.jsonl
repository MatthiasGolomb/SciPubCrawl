The inherent drawback of LTAP is the high reduction tendency of its constituent, Ti<jats:sup>4+</jats:sup> or Ge<jats:sup>4+</jats:sup>, in contact with lithium metal, which results in the generation of insulated reaction products. Several lithium-ion conducting interlayers have been proposed to address this issue, such as lithium nitride, lithium phosphorus oxynitride, polymer electrolytes as well as accustomed organic electrolytes. The two former materials are generally prepared by vapor deposition, which involves considerable cost and makes the preparation of large-sized cells difficult. In contrast, large-sized sheets of polymer electrolytes can be easily fabricated along with little concerns over lithium dendrites formation unlike the case for organic electrolytes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Protected lithium electrodes consisting of lithium metal anode, polymer electrolytes-based interlayers and LTAP are our proposed solution for the practical development of aqueous lithium air battery.

A protected lithium electrode capable of delivering a high areal capacity of 12 mAh\u00b7cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> or more at no less than 1.0 mA\u00b7cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> is critical to develop aqueous lithium air batteries for electric vehicle applications. However, the binary polymer electrolytes we are developing usually exhibit a low limiting diffusion current density and are prone to initiate lithium dendrite formation when the operating current density exceeds its inherent limiting diffusion current density due to the quick depletion of lithium cations and the accompanying instability of interface. Moreover, the low exchange current density for polymer electrolytes at the interface also limits the rate capability of protected lithium electrodes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Based on our previous findings, we are now envisaging a new concept for the lithium-ion conducting interlayer, such as solvent-in-salt systems and single-ion polymer electrolytes, to diminish the trade-off between the two aforementioned issues for protected lithium electrodes in the development of aqueous lithium air battery.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] N.

However, currently these batteries cannot offer a suitably long driving range (i.e., &gt;300 km) for pure electric vehicles.

Based on the density functional theory, the fluorine substitution in ethyl propyl ether lowers both LUMO and HOMO energy levels, resulting in simultaneously high reduction potential and oxidation stability of the fluorinated ether. The theoretical calculation indicates that the fluorinated electrolyte solvents are thermodynamically more favorable for electrochemical reduction reaction forming a passivation layer on both electrodes than their non-fluorinated counterparts under certain voltage conditions. Our experimental results demonstrated that a binary solvent electrolyte comprising of TTE and 1, 3-dioxolane (DOL) displayed a superior cycling performance in Li-S cell employing a carbon/sulfur nanocomposite electrode with 75% of sulfur content. The new fluorinated electrolyte suppressed the deleterious shuttling effect and therefore improved the capacity retention and coulombic efficiency in cell tests. SEM/EDS analysis confirmed the improved performance was due to the detainment of polysulfides inside the electrode after the formation of a passivation layer.  Also, this electrolyte has an amazing effect on the self-discharge of the Li-S cell and to the best of our knowledge; this is the first electrolyte which has shown excellent shelf life at the fully charged stage.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Reference:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>1.

In addition to a high theoretical energy density (about 2600 Wh/kg), it is made of relatively low-cost and non-poisonous materials. However, it has several disadvantages which result from the solubility of sulfur and of lithium polysulfides (PS) in the battery electrolyte. These include self-discharge, short cycle life and low Coulombic efficiency. In addition, the use of a metallic lithium anode poses safety and reversibility problems. The lithium-ion battery is assembled in the discharged state. Thus, in the case of the lithium ion/sulfur battery, lithium sulfide must be incorporated into the cathode prior to cell assembly. Up to now, a very limited number of papers have been published on the assembly of the lithium/sulfur battery in the discharged state (including: Scrosati, Cai, Hayash, Yang). Another problem related to this battery is the large volume changes of the cathode during cycling. The cathode material expands on discharge and contracts on charge. The molar volume of Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S, is about 80% greater than that of sulfur. This leads to mechanical stress at the cathode and contributes to more rapid degradation of capacity. A novel strategy to overcome the degradation of the sulfur electrode will be described and discussed.

In addition, we fabricated organic/inorganic hybrid block copolymer composite electrolytes with ionic liquids and nanoparticles for improving ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. The effects of composite block copolymer electrolytes were evaluated in terms of ionic conductivity as well as mechanical strength. In addition, interfacial resistance and ESW (electrochemical stability window) were also performed to understand the functions of hybrid components. In particular, these properties could be crucially affected by change of composition of block copolymer and hybrid components, which resulted in the different behavior inside polymer matrix and interface between electrode/electrolyte.</jats:p>"}

This study indicates that degradation may be more significant in the case of the 1NM3 solvent, compared to linear ethers such as tetraglyme or dioxalone, because of its relatively high electron affinity.

A very appealing Li-air configuration is obviously one which sees the use of a solid, solvent-free, electrolyte, such as those formed by combining poly(ethylene oxide), PEO, and a lithium salt. Polymer electrolytes are well known promising materials for high energy density rechargeable batteries. Polymer electrolytes poses several advantages over liquid based electrolytes systems, in terms of high chemical, thermal and electrochemical stabilities, all of those are important factors for batteries in number of applications, ranging from portable electronics to electric vehicles.

Attempts to overcome these problems by developing compatible electrolyte/catalyst combinations have invariably been disappointing. These difficulties could be overcome by adopting a new cell configuration consisting of a lithium metal anode in the conventional organic electrolyte separated by a lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte from the air electrode in an aqueous catholyte. Accordingly, this presentation will focus on the development of catholytes that can avoid corrosion of the solid electrolyte as well as efficient, inexpensive electroctalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A buffer catholyte solution with a moderate pH, consisting of phosphoric acid and a supporting salt, has been developed to keep the solid electrolyte stable and reduce the internal resistance and overpotential.

In this regard, the low-temperature form of lithium cobalt oxide (designated as LT-lithium cobalt oxide) that adopts a lithiated spinel structure has been developed as an inexpensive, efficient electrocatalyst for OER. Its OER activity is much higher than that of the high-temperature form of lithium cobalt oxide (designated as HT-lithium cobalt oxide), which has a layered structure and is used as a cathode in lithium-ion batteries, and even slightly higher than that of iridium oxide. Although the ORR activity of LT-lithium cobalt oxide is low, a combination of high ORR and OER activity could be realized by chemically extracting lithium from the LT-lithium cobalt oxide, demonstrating the lithium-deficient, spinel-type LT-lithium cobalt oxide as a bifunctional catalyst for rechargeable metal-air batteries. The high OER and ORR activities of spinel-type LT-lithium cobalt oxides are attributed to cubane-like subunits and a pinning of the cobalt-3<jats:italic>d</jats:italic> energy with the top of the oxygen-2<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> band. Furthermore, a novel 3-D O- and N-doped carbon nanoweb (ON-CNW) has been developed as an inexpensive, metal-free catalyst for ORR. The 3-D nanoweb structure provides an ideal backbone support for catalytically active sites due to the fast electron and mass transport properties compared to 1-D or 2-D structures. Also, the synergistic effect between the O and N groups creates highly active pyridone groups all over the nanoweb surface that significantly improves the ORR activity.

From advanced robotics, autonomous aircraft, to hybrid electric vehicles, the number of technologies demanding advanced electrochemical storage solutions is rising. The rechargeable lithium ion battery (LIB) has received considerable attention because of its high operating voltages, low internal resistance and minimal memory effects. Unfortunately LIBs are currently operating close to their theoretical performance limits due to the relatively low capacity of the anode LiC<jats:sub>6 </jats:sub>and the lithiated cathode materials (LiCoO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and LiFePO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>) in widespread use. It has long been understood that a rechargeable lithium metal battery (LMB), which eschewed the use of a carbon host at the anode can lead to as much as a ten-fold improvement in anode storage capacity (from 360 mAh g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> to 3860 mAh g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) and would open up opportunities for high energy un-lithiated cathode materials such as sulfur and oxygen, among others.

It is understood that without significant breakthroughs in this area, the promise of LMBs, as well as of storage platforms based on more earth abundant metals such as Na and Al metal cannot be realized. Specifically, after repeated cycles of charge and discharge growing metal dendrites can bridge the inter-electrode space, producing internal short circuits in the cell. In a volatile electrolyte, ohmic heat generated by these shorts may lead to thermal runaway and catastrophic cell failure, which places obvious safety and performance limitations on the cells. The ohmic heat generated during a short-circuit may also locally melt dendrites to create regions of \u201corphaned\u201d or electrically disconnected metal that results in a steady decrease in storage capacity as a battery is cycled. Lithium-ion batteries (LiB) are designed to remove these risks by hosting the lithium in a conductive carbon host at the anode. However, the small potential difference that separates lithium insertion into versus plating onto carbon can potentially lead to similar failure modes in an overcharged or too quickly charged LiB. Thus, the need for materials that prevent non-uniform electrodeposition of metals such as Li is also implicit in new fast charging LIB technology targeted for electric-drive vehicles. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We have investigated electrodeposition of lithium in simple liquid electrolytes such as propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate, and in nanoporous solids infused with liquid electrolytes. We find that simple liquid electrolytes reinforced with LiXA blends exhibit stable long-term cycling at room temperature, often with no signs of deposition instabilities over hundreds of cycles of charge and discharge and thousands of operating hours. We rationalize these observations with the help of surface energy data for the electrolyte/lithium interface and impedance analysis of the interface during different stages of cell operation.  Our findings provide support for an important recent theoretical prediction that the surface mobility of lithium is significantly enhanced in the presence of LiXA.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"543fig1.jpeg\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>"}

Unfortunately, current configurations, mostly based on a non-aqueous organic liquid electrolyte, suffer from numerous challenges, namely high electrolyte volatility, electrolyte decomposition, low cycle-life, low discharge rates and high discharge/charge over-potential. A very appealing Li-air configuration is obviously one which sees the use of a solid, solvent-free, electrolyte, such as those formed by combining poly(ethylene oxide), PEO, and a lithium salt. Polymer electrolytes are well known promising materials for high energy density rechargeable batteries. Polymer electrolytes poses several advantages over liquid based electrolytes systems, in terms of high chemical, thermal and electrochemical stabilities, all of those are important factors for batteries in number of applications, ranging from portable electronics to electric vehicles. However, wide use of solid polymer electrolyte is still prevented by the decay in ionic conductivity (10<jats:sup>-7</jats:sup> to 10<jats:sup>-5</jats:sup> S cm<jats:sup>-1 </jats:sup>at room temperature), resulting from low ionic mobility, high degree of polymer matrix crystallinity, and low degree of charge separation in addition to ion association. We hereby offer a new Li-air battery configuration, based on the well-investigated PEO- lithium salt electrolyte system. The Li-air battery will be comprised of a lithium metal anode, a highly Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> conductive, oxygen permeable PEO-based, lithium polymer electrolyte and a high surface area carbon air cathode.  As opposed to current lithium polymer electrolytes, which operate at room temperature and suffer from low ionic conductivity, the new proposed configuration will operate at a high temperature of 80\u00b0c. Above 70\u00b0c PEO predominantly exists in the amorphous state, thus a practically useful conductivity is easily achievable in the temperature range of 70-95\u00b0c. Our Li-air cell is discharged/ charged at high temperature, thus enabling better kinetics, resulting in high current densities and lower over-potential. The system is studied by electrochemical methods as well as spectroscopic ones.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The results of this work will contribute to the development of practically viable Li-air batteries.</jats:p>"}

However, these electrolytes feature only a low ionic conductivity (up to 10<jats:sup>-3 </jats:sup>S cm<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) at room temperature. To use lithium metal in combination with liquid electrolytes, a thin layer (10 \u03bcm) of polyethylene oxide (PEO) was coated on conventional separators. A simple, solvent free technique was used to combine the polymer electrolyte to the separator (patent pending). To enhance the mechanical stability during the swelling with electrolyte, the polymer was cross-linked after the coating step [4].</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>An application of the polymer/separator system is possible with established positive electrode materials like lithium iron phosphate (LFP) or lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) to enhance the energy density of the system. Even more promising is the use in next generation battery systems like lithium air and lithium-sulfur. The thin layer of PEO optimizes the lithium-electrolyte interface and therefore acts as a protective layer against parasitic reactions like electrolyte decomposition [5]. In Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>and Li-S batteries, the PEO could additionally act as a barrier against, respectively, oxygen or polysulfide diffusion to the lithium anode.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The PEO layer was found to be mechanically stable during cell assembling and electrolyte application. Due to the cross-linking, even an excess of electrolyte does not dissolve the polymer. By chemical bonding between the PEO and polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP) a loss of connection between the two separator layers is prevented. Partly impregnation of PEO into porous ceramic separators during the coating process shows the same effect after cross-linking. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests show that PEO and ionic liquids form an amorphous layer on the lithium surface, similar to ternary polymer electrolytes [6].</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To verify the electrochemical stability of the PEO on the lithium metal surface, stripping-plating tests in symmetrical lithium cells were performed with a broad range of electrolytes.

Li-air batteries are appealing in this regard as they offer much higher energy density than the current Li-ion batteries. However, the nonaqueous Li-air batteries are hampered by electrolyte degradation and clogging of the air electrodes by the insoluble discharge products. Interestingly, hybrid Li-air batteries in which a solid electrolyte separates the lithium metal anode in an aprotic electrolyte from the air electrode in an aqueous catholyte could overcome these problems. However, there are many challeges that need to be overcome, <jats:italic>e.g.,</jats:italic>poor stability of the solid electrolyte in strongly acidic or alkaline catholytes, high internal resistance, and lack of less expensive, efficient, durable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. Much effort has been focused on developing efficient bifunctionl catalysts to lower the overpotential and improve the stability of hybrid Li-air batteries in recent years, but the cycle life is still limited. This presentation will focus on advanced cell configurations and high-performance catalysts for hybrid lithium-air batteries.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We have developed an advanced hybrid Li-air cell with decoupled, mesoporous nanocatalysts, which could be cycled for over 100 cycles (400 hours) in air with only 0.08 V increase in round-trip overpotential based on discharge and charge end voltages. With this cell configuration, mesoporous NiCo<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> nanoflakes directly grown onto a nickel foam (NCONF@Ni) serve as the OER electrode. The catalytic active surface area increased from &lt; 1 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> for nickel foam to more than 80 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>. The spinel NiCo<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> catalyst exhibits much higher catalytic activity and stability than Ni metal at high potentials, leading to a fairly low OER overpotential that is comparable to that seen with the noble-metal IrO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> catalyst. A nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (NMC) with extremely high surface area (1520 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) and optimized nitrogen doping content (3.9 wt. %) was loaded onto a hydrophobic carbon fiber paper to act as the ORR electrode. The highly mesoporous NMC exhibits activity similar to the noble-metal Pt/C catalyst, but with much better stability. With this configuration, a variety of other non-noble-metal or metal-free catalysts could play the role of ORR without worrying about their stability in the high-voltage charge process. For example, we have developed a 3-D O- and N-doped carbon nanoweb as a highly active metal-free catalyst for ORR in hybrid Li-air cells. The 3-D nanoweb structure provides an ideal backbone support for catalytically active sites due to the fast electron and mass transport properties compared with the 1-D or 2-D structure. In addition, the synergistic effect between the O and N groups creates highly active pyridone groups all over the nanoweb surface, which significantly improves the catalytic activity toward ORR.   </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Furthermore, a phosphate buffer catholyte with a moderate pH has been developed to protect the solid electrolyte in hybrid Li-air batteries. It contains phosphoric acid and supporting salts, which reduce the internal resistance and overpotential. A high energy density could be achieved by utilizing all three protons in phosphoric acid. Further increase in power density and efficiency has also been realized by increasing the solid-electrolyte conductivity and the operating temperature to 40 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C.</jats:p>"}

The AAO film shows higher wettability with smaller contact angle as value of 0<jats:sup>o</jats:sup> than commercial separator (36<jats:sup>o</jats:sup>).

The electrolyte uptakes of the AAO film and the commercial separator are determined to be 126.88 wt% and 264.28 wt% respectively. [3] The density of the AAO film (3.98g/cm3) is smaller than the commercial separator (14.23g/cm3), so they required less electrolyte to operate LIB. Although less amount of electrolyte is used, the AAO film shows higher ionic conductivity of 2.06 mS/cm with SUS electrode than the commercial separator (0.66 mS/cm). This can be explained by low contact angle, which is agreed with low bulk resistance and higher permittivity of AAO film, it contributes to ionic conductivity.

The AAO film and commercial separator showed similar capacity at 0.2C, the highest values were 123.0 mAh/g for AAO film and 122.6 mAh/g for commercial separator. Capacity recovery test was evaluated to confirm the correspondence with high energy LIB. Commercial separator was degraded from 1C rate and did not recovered. However, in case of AAO film, the capacity maintained 110.9 mAh/g at 0.5C, 88.4 mAh/g at 1C rate and recovered 121.1 mAh/g after investigation. And the AAO film showed high columbic efficiency over 98% at 0.5C rate. These excellent electrochemical characteristics related to Li dendrite.

These properties coupled with the low cost and non-toxicity of sulfur makes lithium-sulfur batteries very attractive for multiple battery applications. One of the major problems of lithium-sulfur batteries, however, is their poor cycle life. Typically 20-50% of the capacity is lost in around 100 cycles. This poor cycleability results from the parasitic reaction known as the polysulfide shuttle.  </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The polysulfide shuttle exists because the polysulfide discharge products of the sulfur electrode, S<jats:sub>8</jats:sub>\n                  <jats:sup>2-</jats:sup> and S<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>\n                  <jats:sup>2-</jats:sup>, are soluble in the electrolyte. These soluble polysulfide species diffuse towards the lithium anode where they are reduced. Afterwards, the reduced polysulfides shuttle back towards the sulfur cathode where they have to be re-oxidized.<jats:sup>1-2</jats:sup>During cycling, this phenomenon causes incomplete charging. When the cell is idle, this phenomenon results in self-discharge.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The polysulfide shuttle also impacts the cycle life because some of the reduced polysulfide discharge products formed at the anode, S<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n                  <jats:sup>2-</jats:sup> and S<jats:sup>2-</jats:sup>, are insoluble. Normally during cycling, these insoluble discharge products are produced at the sulfur cathode where they can later be re-oxidized. However, when these insoluble discharge products are produced at the lithium anode, they will precipitate out and cause an irreversible capacity loss. We herein present a technique of directly measuring the currents associated with the polysulfide shuttle and an analysis of how these shuttle currents impact the performance of the cell.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The technique of measuring shuttle currents is based on reversing the inherent self-discharge caused by the shuttle process. The current measured by holding the cell voltage constant results from the shuttle process. In this case, as soon as the soluble polysulfide species diffuse from the cathode, the concentration gradient of sulfur species at the cathode will change, affecting the potential of the cell. In order for the cell to maintain its potential, the cell must oxidize polysulfide species at the cathode as they shuttle back.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The shuttle currents measured at various cell voltages are shown in Figure 1. We present analysis of these shuttle currents as a function of state-of-charge, cell design, and additives.

Due to development of such technologies, large growth of the marked demands on the batteries of this type is expected. It is due to the intensive impact put on technologies of the electric cars and large-scale batteries dedicated to storage of energy from renewable sources.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Unfortunately, global lithium resources, currently estimated at 29 million tonnes, are not sufficient to fulfill these demands. Therefore, studies on batteries which are alternative to lithium-based energy sources are conducted intensively. A natural candidate to replace the lithium is sodium. Standard potential of the Na/Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> (-2.71 V) is similar to the potential of Li/Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> (-3.05 V). Sodium is the most abundant alkali metal on Earth\u2019s crust and therefore the above-mentioned problems of the use of the lithium do not occur in case of sodium or Na-ion batteries. Moreover, sodium materials are cheaper than lithium.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The first successful attempt to use sodium in batteries took place in 1967, after the discovery of the ionic conductivity of the \u03b2-alumina (Na<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O\u00b711Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>). Sodium cations were responsible for the ionic transport in this system. The ionic conductivity of this material was approximately 10 S/cm at 300\u00b0C. As \u03b2-alumina does not exhibit electronic conductivity, it was judged as a promising, ceramic electrolyte. On this basis, high temperature, sodium-sulfur battery (with sodium and sulfur as electrode materials) was constructed. The range of the operating temperatures for this battery was 300-400\u00b0C, OCV was between 2.1 V and 1.8 V (at the final stage of discharge). Though the good reversibility, the battery did not achieve the commercial success due to high operating temperature, problems related to the corrosion of the electrodes, low safety of use. Also the aspect of the overcharge control remained unsolved, which was of high importance because of very high internal resistance of the fully charged cell.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Simultaneously, studies on the Na/NiCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> battery were conducted. The design of this system was similar to the Na / S cell. The liquid sulfur cathode was replaced by solid nickel chloride. Additionally, an electrolyte intermediate (NaAlCl<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>) was used in order to enhance contact between the solid cathode and solid electrolyte. This battery was characterized with better safety of use (mainly due to the fact that there was no metal sodium in the battery when it was installed- the anode material was produced at the anode during the first charging) and operated at lower temperatures (250-350\u00b0C). Also high OCV (about 2.5 V) was advantage of the proposed battery.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Na-NaSICON-S battery, designed in 2000, became real success. The system exhibited very high energy density. On the other hand, the problem of the high temperature of work at which the batteries are working (270-350\u00b0C) remained unsolved.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>High-temperature sodium cells, despite the many benefits are not competitive in many applications. The construction of the power source for the portable device needs to be simple and safe. When application of the battery in the uninterruptible power source (UPS) is taken into consideration, the battery should work no later than 1 s after switching on. These expectations cannot be fulfilled by the high-temperature battery.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The idea of the low-temperature sodium battery may be realized by preparing the system which is analog of the lithium anode or Li-ion battery. The main issue deciding on the successful application of the sodium battery is stability of the interface between sodium or Na-ion anode and the electrolyte. This limits possible range of the solvents to the polyethers, as organic carbonates as well as their mixtures are unstable versus metallic sodium and Na-ion anode.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In the presentation, we present conductivity and CV results of the Na-based electrolytes. The compositions of the electrolytes were optimized in order to obtain system of highest conductivity. The obtained data were confronted with spectroscopic studies of the system in order to discuss the influence of the salt concentration and temperature on the formation of the various ionic agglomerates.</jats:p>"}

Especially, Tf<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>N<jats:sup>-</jats:sup> forms ILs not only 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>mim<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>), but also various aliphatic quaternary ammonium (AQA<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>). The AQA-Tf<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>N exhibited large apparent electrochemical windows enough wide to use a solvent free electrolyte for 4 V-class battery applications with the use of lithium metal anode. [1] The cathodic stability of AQA-Tf<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>N<jats:sub> </jats:sub>such as N-methyl-N-butylpyrrolidinium indeed enough negative to perform lithium redox in the ILs, however, another amide ILs composed of f<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>N<jats:sup>-</jats:sup> (bis(fluoromethylsulfonyl)amide) also exhibited very good lithium redox on metal electrodes even in the [C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>mim][f<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>N]. [2] Considering that the addition of lithium salts in [C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>mim][Tf<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>N] extended their cathodic limit enough negative potential [3], the existence of a lithium salt also one of the important factor to exhibit good lithium redox in C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>mim-ILs, however, no good lithium redox was observed in the [C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>mim][Tf<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>N]. The [C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>mim][f<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>N] could be used as a 4V class battery with the use of not only the lithium metal anode but also conventional carbon anodes. [4] The most striking point of such f<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>N<jats:sup>-</jats:sup>-based ILs was the rate performance was quite high among various ILs composed of perfluoroanions. [5]</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> We have recently much focused on one of asymmetric amide such as (fluoromethylsulfonyl)(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide (fTfN<jats:sup>-</jats:sup>) because the anions possesses superior ability to reduce melting point of their salts. Not only tetraethylammonium but also 5-azoniaspiro[4.4.]nonane, which exhibited much high melting point with the Tf<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>N<jats:sup>-</jats:sup> and the f<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>N<jats:sup>-</jats:sup>, forms ILs with fTfN<jats:sup>-</jats:sup>. Furthermore, these ILs could be used as a full cell application with the use of carbon anode like f<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>N<jats:sup>-</jats:sup>. [6,7] These results strongly suggest that the existence of FSO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>- group in amide anions have an important substituent in the application of ILs as lithium battery electrolytes. One of the possible reasons for such good performance even in C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>mim<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>-ILs might be due to the existence of good SEI film on an electrode, which protects further decomposition of cathodically unstable C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>mim<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>  In this presentation, we would like to show C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>mim-ILs composed of one of the cyclic amides (cTf<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>N) also exhibited very good lithium redox on a metal electrode. This seems important because the good lithium redox can be achieved in C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>mim-ILs without FSO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>- group. To discuss the effect of such anion dependence on the lithium redox in C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>mim-ILs, EQCM measurements were performed. The results indicate that a certain surface film on the metal electrode formed in both the [C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>mim][f<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>N] and the [C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>mim][cTf<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>N]. However the mass change observed in the former ILs was much larger than the latter. From these results, FSO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n                  <jats:sup>-</jats:sup> group in amide anion might be act as a surface modification reagents like a carbonate solvent molecule. On the other hand, the results for cyclic amide without FSO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>- group indicate that the anion structure is quite important to achieve good lithium cyclability.  All these results imply that C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>mim-ILs also attractive candidate for a 4 V - class lithium battery electrolyte if we choose appropriate anions.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] H.

Among a wide range of possible cathode materials elemental sulfur has the highest theoretical capacity of 1675 mAh/g which makes it a promising candidate as a positive electrode material.[1] However, the poor cycle life and rate capability of sulfur cathodes have limited the practical application of this attractive technology. Sulfur is highly electronically and ionically insulating which makes the use of conductive additives such as carbon black inevitable. Polysulfides, being generated during cyclization, dissolve in the liquid electrolyte and shuttle between the anode and cathode to react chemically and cause a loss of active material. Furthermore, the final product of the sulfur reduction, Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S, is highly insulating and partially responsible for the rising electrode resistance during cycling. Precipitation of solid lithium sulfide is assumed to proceed both, on cathode and on anode side.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Different carbon materials are widely used as cathode additives as they offer a high electronic conductivity coupled with low mass and a high surface area.[2] Recently, significant progress has been achieved using structured meso- and microporous carbons as host materials for sulfur. In order to prevent the loss of active material by dissolution, the conductive matrix is assumed to constrain the highly soluble polysulfide inside the cathode by chemical or physical interactions. Therefore, the parasitic polysulfide shuttle and undesired side reactions with the lithium anode can be mitigated. Moreover, structured carbons have a stabilizing impact on the structural integrity of the cathode matrix, as they are able to compensate the mechanical stress arising from the volume expansion during the chemical conversion of sulfur into lithium sulfide. [3]</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Here, we present novel, nitrogen-enriched, nanostructured carbons (MPC) as cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries. Synthesized via hard-template approach, the obtained materials exhibit a well-defined mesoporous structure with a nitrogen content of approx. 10 %, enabling the possibility of sulfur infiltration. Due to a high specific surface area (400 \u2013 500 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/g), enhanced polysulfide adsorption and good mechanical stability, cathodes with a high active material loading (above 2 mg/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) and improved cycling performance can be fabricated.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Significantly improved specific and areal capacities were achieved over 200 cycles with an increased sulfur loading.

However, there are also several issues to be handled before commercial application.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Firstly, different from traditional lithium-ion batteries, intermediate polysulfides generate and dissolve in the organic electrolyte during the discharge process of lithium-sulfur batteries. The dissolved polysulfides, shuttle between cathode and anode sides, lowering the utilization of sulfur and also react with the lithium anode without any electron transfer. However, the dissolution of polysulfide in a lithium-sulfur battery is highly dependent on the sulfur/electrolyte loading. Thus an appropriate dosage of electrolyte will build a concentration gradient, which will limit the dissolution of polysfulfides. In our work, A lithium-sulfur cell with a high initial discharge capacity of 1053 mAh g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> at a high rate of 1 C and an ultralow decay rate of 0.049 %/per cycle during 1000 cycles was obtained by using CNT-sulfur cathode and suppressing polysulfide shuttle to a shuttle factor of 0.02 by matching the sulfur/electrolyte loading.

Generally, the addition of conductive materials will neutralize the advantage in high energy density of lithium-sulfur battery. Thus, the more sulfur content in the composite cathode, the larger energy density. Herein, we employed the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to build the unblocked conductive skeleton and a room-temperature, one-step ball-milling treatment of aligned CNTs and sulfur was applied to obtain high sulfur content of 90 %. The 90 % sulfur loading cathode exhibited a superior density of 1.98 g cm<jats:sup>-3</jats:sup> (2.07 g cm<jats:sup>-3</jats:sup>for sulfur), which will greatly increase the volumetric energy density of lithium-sulfur battery.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Reference:</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] XB Cheng, et al. <jats:italic>J.

However, present available lithium ion technology could not satisfy the increasing demand on energy density.

For instance, Li-S and Li-O<jats:sub>2 </jats:sub>batteries have high theoretical specific energy density of 2654 Wh/kg and 3500 Wh/kg, respectively. However, metallic lithium batteries inevitably suffer from the safety concern due to the formation of lithium dendrite during cycling. Generally, the employed electrolyte plays an important role in influencing the interfacial properties and morphology of the metallic lithium anode. Thus, in order to make the metallic lithium anode stable in long cycling process, here, we show a new class of \u201cSolvent-in-Salt\u201d (SIS) electrolyte with ultrahigh lithium salt concentration, in which salt holds a dominant position in whole lithium ion transport system (1,2). This new electrolyte remarkably enhances cyclic and safety performance of rechargeable metallic lithium batteries via effectively suppressing the formation of lithium dendrites and greatly reducing the degree of damage of metallic lithium anode.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>  In this presentation we will take lithium-sulfur battery as an example to show the power of SIS. Compared with traditional non-aqueous electrolyte (usually 1-2 mol/L), the SIS electrolyte (5-7 mol/1 L) exhibits the unique physicochemical properties: high lithium transference number (0.73), high viscosity (72 cP) and acceptable ionic conductivity (0.814 mS/cm @ room-temperature) as well as low glass transition temperature of -77.3oC. When used in Li-S batteries, the Li storage performance is significantly improved. It shows an initial specific discharge capacity of 1041 mAh/g at a rate of 0.2C and maintains a reversible capacity of  770 mAh/g with capacity retention of 74% after 100 cycles. More importantly, the coulombic efficiency reaches nearly 100% after the first cycle (the first one is 93.7%). The improved performance can be ascribed to 1) the dissolution of polysulfides in electrolyte is fully inhibited and 2) the corrosion of lithium anode is greatly reduced and the formation of lithium dendrites is effectively suppressed in this ultrahigh salt concentration electrolyte. Furthermore, we optimized the composition of the SIS electrolyte and carbon supports and further improved the performance (3).

The formation of SEI of good properties- stable in time and ion-conducting layer formed on the interface of the electrode is still a problem. If such layer was formed, majority of problems related to the construction of sodium-based batteries would be solved. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> One of the possible approaches which may lead to overcoming of the above-mentioned problems is use of the novel types of the salt. In early 2000s, Armand proposed a novel type of the salts, with five-membered ring consisting of carbon and nitrogen, in which all the carbon atoms are substituted with cyano groups. The architecture of the proposed anion leads to distribution of the charge on all the nitrogen atoms. Moreover, the ion pairing in the lithium or sodium salts of such anions is relatively weak due to fact that cations are \u201chard\u201d acids and nitrogen atoms are \u201csoft\u201d bases. The nitrogen-rich salt is also interesting due to fact that introduction of the nitrogen to SEI leads to the better properties of this layer. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> In the recent years several heteroaromatic salts, derivatives of triazole, imidazole and pyrrole were synthesized and their crystallographic and spectral data were published. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> In the present study we focus on the study of solvates of the salts shown above, and on the influence of the structure of the crystalline complexes on their vibrational spectra. The main impact is put on complexes of the salts with dimethyl ethers of ethylene glycol oligomers (glymes), due to their importance as model systems for poly(ethylene oxide) based electrolytes. Variety of the negatively charged sites available for cation complexation leads to the formation of adducts with different structure, being models for single ions, ionic pairs or aggregates. Also simulations of the formation of the ionic agglomerates in ether-based systems has good support when the presented results are taken into consideration. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> It is worth to stress out that there is not any electrolyte based on organic carbonates which is stable against material of the anode in the state-of-the-art. Therefore, ethers are one of interesting candidates for solvents dedicated to battery with the sodium-type (metallic Na, Na-ion and similar) anode. What is also important, the compatibility (as well as solubility) of the studied salts with organic carbonates is weak and, due to this, solubility of the studied salts in carbonates is too small to use such solutions as electrolytes in real battery systems produced in the industrial scale. </jats:p>"}

A considerable interest is attracted by metallic lithium anode-based Li-S and Li-air batteries because of their high specific capacity [2]. Nevertheless, the use of a metallic lithium anode compromises the chemical and electrochemical stability of the electrolyte. To address these drawbacks, a significant research effort is recently devoted to the design and preparation of new lithium-conducting electrolytes. Here, a new concept of electrolyte based on a solid-state lithium single-ion conductor is proposed, which opens new perspectives in the development of advanced lithium batteries [3]. The electrolyte is obtained by direct reaction of nanometric fluorinated TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (FT) with molten metallic lithium, and consists of nanoparticles (NPs) with surface anionic groups neutralized by lithium cations. The resulting nanopowder is labelled LiFT<jats:sup>\u00ae </jats:sup>[4]. It should be highlighted that after functionalization, the conductivity of fluorinated TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> increases by more than four orders of magnitude. In this work, the structure of LiFT is elucidated by means of several techniques such as: Inductively-Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES); High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM), powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-MIR and -FIR), electrochemical measurements and solid-state Magic-Angle Spinning-NMR (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy. XRD and HR-TEM measurements show that LiFT has the \u201ccore\u201d structure of anatase, with Li cations present only in the external lithium-rich shell of NPs. Thus, no intercalation processes of Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> in \u201ccore\u201d LiFT NPs take place. In addition, it is demonstrated that lithium cations can migrate through grain boundaries of electrolyte NPs in a very effective way, achieving: 1) a room-temperature single-ion conductivity of about 3x10<jats:sup>-4</jats:sup> Scm<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>; 2) an excellent electrochemical stability; and 3) a high exchange current density. All these features, together with an easy synthesis process, which is based on precursors obtained from very cheap starting materials, make LiFT a very attractive material for application in several fields such as: a) all-solid-state lithium batteries; b) molten electrode lithium batteries; c) nanocomposite electrolytes and d) lithium-air batteries.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1]      M.

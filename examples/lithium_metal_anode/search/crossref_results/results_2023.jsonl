In contrast to lithium-ion battery, the negative electrode of AFLMB does not contain any active materials, resulting in a two-fold increase in energy density. As a result, the charging mechanism on the negative electrode in AFLMB is based on electrodeposition of lithium, rather than intercalation of lithium ions. Unfortunately, that causes a series of problems, such as lithium dendrite formation, volume expansion, broken SEI and dead lithium accumulation, leading to the low cycling stability of AFLMB. Consequently, interfacial characteristics of the negative electrode (usually copper) play a critical role in determining the morphology of lithium deposits which largely affects the issues mentioned above. Understanding the mechanism of lithium electrodeposition across the electrode-electrolyte interface is crucial to design a better copper electrode for long-cyclability AFLMB.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The interfacial characteristics of copper are mainly influenced by crystal phase, surface roughness and defects. While the effects of crystal phase and surface roughness on lithium electrodeposition have been extensively studied, the role of micro-scale defects has been seldom discussed, despite their potential to strongly influence the surface properties of copper. Therefore, this work focuses on elucidating the elementary process about how the defects on copper affect the lithium nucleation and subsequent growth. Specifically, we use (111)-nanotwinned and (111)-preferred orientation copper foils with the same surface roughness to conduct a series of electrochemical measurements. The presence of nanotwin structure can reduce the grain boundary and atomic step density, a type of the defects with high surface energy, on the copper. Before lithium electrodeposition, solvents and anions in an electrolyte adsorb on the electrode-electrolyte interface to form the electric double layer. During this process, the atomic steps with high surface energy on copper can establish strong adsorption with the substance in the electrolyte. The solvents adsorbed on the defects may hinder the reduction of anion. Accordingly, the (111)-nanotwinned Cu foil with fewer defects induces the formation of LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which is beneficial to the transportation of lithium ions. In cyclic voltammetry test, the (111)-nanotwinned Cu foil exhibits higher reduction current density of the precipitation of LiF (Fig. 1).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>For lithium electrodeposition, during the initial stage, lithium adatoms tend to adsorb on the defects with high surface energy on the copper surface, where other adatoms accumulate to form stable nucleus. Subsequently, the nucleus on each nucleation sites might have different growth direction and crystal phase, resulting in a lot of independent lithium grains. In other words, compared to the (111)-preferred orientation substrate, the (111)-nanotwinned Cu foil with less nucleation sites provides more space for the nucleus to grow in 2-D direction, which leads to the lower nucleation overpotential (Fig. 2 a). That result also facilitates the formation of larger lithium grains with smaller surface area exposed to the electrolyte (Fig. 3). As shown in Figure 2 (b), quasi-steady state over-potential of Li plating on the (111)-nanotwinned Cu is generally larger than that on the (111)-preferred orientation Cu foil, which has been ascribed to the high local current density on larger lithium grains. The quasi-steady state overpotential of Li plating on the (111)-preferred orientation Cu foil gradually increased with the cycle number, which might be attributable to the relatively unstable SEI and the accumulation of dead lithium with the GCD cycling. Furthermore, the (111)-nanotwinned Cu foil always exhibits a lower quasi-steady state overpotential of lithium stripping in comparison with the (111)-preferred orientation substrate at each cycle, probably resulting from the uniform Li deposit and the special LiF-rich SEI formation due to the nanotwinned structure. In the cycling stability test (Figure 2 c), for the Cu//Li cell using the (111)-nanotwinned Cu foil, the coulombic efficiency was kept being around 90% in this 160-cycle test. However, for the Cu//Li cell using the (111)-preferred orientation Cu foil, the coulombic efficiency is generally lower than that of the cell using the (111)-nanotwinned Cu foil at the cycle number &gt; 15. In addition, the coulombic efficiency starts to obviously decay at the 135th cycle and becomes lower than 5% at the 160th cycle.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To sum up, we proposed a mechanism about how the defects affect the reaction at electrode-electrolyte interface. The nanotwinned columnar grains reduces the atomic density on the copper surface, which effectively reduces the formation of lithium dendrite, the accumulation of dead lithium and broken SEI. The (111)-nanotwinned Cu foil is proved to be a superior substrate for lithium deposition and stripping, significantly improving the Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>/Li redox reversibility and cycling stability.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"878fig1.jpg\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>"}

In detail, negatively charged titania nanosheets with densely packed nanopores on them are prepared. These holey nanosheets in the electrolyte move spontaneously onto the anode under electrical field, building a mesoporous structure on the electrode surface.

However, the inevitable side reactions of LVP with a traditional liquid-state electrolyte under high voltage, as well as the uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites, worsen the cycling performance. Herein, a hybrid solid-state electrolyte is prepared by the confinement of a lithium-containing ionic liquid with a mesoporous SiO2 scaffold, and used for a LVP-cathode-based lithium metal battery. The solid-state electrolyte not only exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 3.14 \u00d7 10\u22124 S cm\u22121 at 30 \u00b0C and a wide electrochemical window of about 5 V, but also has good compatibility with the LVP cathode material. Moreover, the cell paired with a solid-state electrolyte exhibits good reversibility and can realize a stable operation at a voltage of up to 4.8 V, and the discharge capacity is well-maintained after 100 cycles, which demonstrates excellent capacity retention. As a contrast, the cell paired with a conventional liquid-state electrolyte shows only an 87.6% discharge capacity retention after 100 cycles. In addition, the effectiveness of a hybrid solid-state electrolyte in suppressing dendritic lithium is demonstrated.

However, the overgrowth of lithium dendrites and the low lithium\u2010ion diffusion rate at low temperatures limit the further application of lithium metal anodes. Here, the applied magnetic field is introduced inside the lithium metal anode by using a novel magnetic metal\u2010organic framework as a current collector. The magnetic field can improve the conductivity of this novel current collector, thus accelerating the diffusion of lithium ions in the battery, an advantage that is particularly prominent at low temperatures. In addition, the current collector can stabilize the solid electrolyte interface and inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance. The symmetrical cell at room temperature can exceed 4600\u00a0h with a hysteresis voltage of only 9\u00a0mV.

As a result, much of the research aimed at enabling practical Li-metal batteries emphasizes tuning SEI composition, either via electrolyte formulation<jats:sup>1\u20135</jats:sup> or synthesis of artificial SEIs.<jats:sup>6\u20138</jats:sup> Ideally, the lithium SEI should minimize parasitic side reactions by effectively passivating Li while also promoting facile conduction of lithium ions (Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>). To do this, SEI materials must have high (electro)chemical stability, be ionically conductive, and be sufficiently mechanically robust to accommodate substantial volume changes. However, studying these properties in bulk-scale materials often yields values that diverge by orders of magnitude from those observed in SEIs. For example, typical SEI ionic conductivities lie in the range of 10<jats:sup>-7</jats:sup>-10<jats:sup>-9 </jats:sup>S cm<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>, yet bulk ionic conductivity measurements of relevant materials such as lithium carbonate, lithium fluoride, and lithium oxide ranges from 10<jats:sup>-18</jats:sup> and 10<jats:sup>-10</jats:sup> S cm<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>.<jats:sup>9</jats:sup> Our group has developed a technique to directly study these materials at realistic length scales by synthesizing model interphases through the reaction of gases with Li.<jats:sup>10,11</jats:sup> Our previous work on Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O and LiF revealed that Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O is a better Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> conductor than LiF (~1 x 10<jats:sup>-9</jats:sup> S cm<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> vs ~5.2 x 10<jats:sup>-10 </jats:sup>S cm<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>),<jats:sup>11</jats:sup> and that these species\u2019 chemical stability varies substantially in different electrolytes.<jats:sup>12</jats:sup> One of the remaining key SEI materials is lithium carbonate, which has been proposed to act as a metastable phase in the outer portion of the SEI.<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this work, we have developed a technique to synthesize Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>CO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> films via sequential reaction of oxygen and carbon dioxide with clean lithium surfaces. Using scanning electron microscopy and air-exposure tests, we can confirm that these films are conformal and generally pinhole-free. Titration gas chromatography (TGC)<jats:sup>14</jats:sup> was used to quantify relative proportions of lithium carbonate, metallic lithium, and lithium carbide, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) offers insights into how composition changes across the depth of the film. These films were then used as a platform to further investigate the reactivity of Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>CO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> with different electrolytes, comparing carbonates versus ethers and varying the lithium salt used. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) offers insights into the evolution of transport properties at these interphases, while electrolyte soak tests coupled with gas chromatography of gas-phase products and TGC of solid-phase products can track their chemical evolution. Taken together, this work illuminates how lithium carbonate may evolve during battery cycling, offering perspective that can help guide future design of Li-metal SEIs.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References <jats:list list-type=\"roman-lower\">\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>Liu, Y. <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic> Solubility-mediated sustained release enabling nitrate additive in carbonate electrolytes for stable lithium metal anode. <jats:italic>Nat.

Lithium\u2013sulfur battery with a high-energy-density is regarded as a third-generation rechargeable battery with high potential for commercialization. The well charged and discharged lithium\u2013sulfur battery can generate specific energy density of up to 600 W\u2219h kg<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>. However, the charging product, sulfur, and the discharging product, lithium sulfide, both have low conductivity, which lead to low active material utilization and excessive addition of conductive materials, lowering the active material content and performance in the cathode region. The liquid active material, polysulfides, formed in the middle of the cycling reaction will dissolve in the electrolyte, causing leakage to the lithium anode to form a non-reactive lithium sulfide layer, causing severe capacity fading. Furthermore, the repeated transformation of sulfur (solid-state), polysulfides (liquid-state), and lithium sulfur (solid-state) active materials led to the sluggish battery reaction and irreversible electrolyte consumption.

Porous conductive network is a common cathode material, which provides a large surface area and great polysulfides absorbability. However, as a result of high-sulfur-loading and lean-electrolyte cathode batteries, a low specific capacity and short cycle life are discovered, which is affected by the high electrolyte consumption. Accordingly, a carbon electrospun substrate with a non-nanoporous structure was introduced as the conductive network to achieve the high-energy-density battery design. To fabricate the free-standing sulfur cathode, sulfur powder was loaded between two porous carbon electrospun substrate by a hot-pressing technique. The cathode consists of three layers: carbon current collector, melt-in sulfur layer, and carbon interlayer, forming a sandwich-like cathode.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>With this design, we can accommodate high areal loading of sulfur (8 mg cm<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup>) in the cathode area while lessening the conductive additive (sulfur content of 73 wt%).

For that reason, people have focused on developing new chemistry/system to improve the energy density, cycle life and safe energy storage system for practical applications. Anode free lithium metal battery (AFLMB) is one of the alternate choices and new system for high energy density storage system because it has no active anode material initially. In addition, the fabrication of AFLMB is simple, low-cost, safe since Li metal is not directly used as an anode. However, since the Li amount is limited and electrolyte decomposition, consuming Li during the SEI formation, the capacity can fade quickly relative to LMB. The dead Li can affect the Coulombic efficiency, polarization, and cycle life of the cell during continues cycles of AFLMB. However, AFLMB is the best system to understand the detail chemistry like quantification of dead Li, polarization effect, electrolyte consumption easily compared to the LMB.

When used alongside a lithium metal anode they can offer the high energy densities [1] required to meet the increasing demand for energy storage. However, they suffer from numerous issues which predominately occur at the cathode- or anode-SE interface. Issues include dendrite propagation through gaps, pores and grain boundaries of the solid electrolyte which can eventually puncture electrolyte crystallites and lead to cell failure. [2] Thiophosphate electrolytes are also unstable both chemically and electrochemically. As a result of the SEs having a low electrochemical stability window reduction or oxidation can occur at the anode or cathode interface, forming a resistive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). [3] Finally, the ionic contact between Li metal anode and electrolyte is poor and thus high interfacial impedances can arise. These impedances can be dynamic which increase during stripping of the lithium and decrease during plating. [4] To solve some of the interfacial issues there is the option to add a small of amount of liquid electrolyte at the lithium metal-electrolyte interface. The liquid electrolyte can fill in the gaps and pores at the interface thus improving the ionic contact whilst allowing a more stable interface. Whilst the ionic contact can be improved the inherent instability of thiophosphate electrolytes against the liquid electrolyte means that a new interphase known as the solid-liquid electrolyte interphase (SLEI) can form. The presence of this interphase can therefore lower the energy density and round-trip efficiencies of cells which utilize hybrid electrolytes meaning that minimizing the SLEI resistance and maximizing total ionic conductivities is important in hybrid cells. [5]</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this work a hybrid of the thiophosphate argyrodite Li<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>PS<jats:sub>5</jats:sub>Cl and the ionic liquid x-LiTFSI-1-butyl 1-methylpiperidinium TFSI (BMPipTFSI) with LiTFSI concentrations of 0.25 M and 0.5 M was studied. The choice of SE and liquid electrolyte boils down to the high ionic conductivity of the SE and the electrochemical and thermal stability of the ionic liquid. Temperature-dependent ionic conductivity measurements showed that hybrid systems exhibit lower in room temperature ionic conductivities and higher total activation energies. This hints at the presence of a SLEI forming between the LE and SE. To study how the SLEI resistances changes over time, ion blocking potential impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed. These measurements were performed at 10 \u00b0C to allow for the resistance contributions to be better resolved and showed a SLEI resistance of around 45-50 \u03a9 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> for both hybrids. Over the period of 130 hours this resistance changed minimally (around 5 \u03a9 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> on average) indicating good stability of the SLEI. To further test the suitability of this hybrid alongside lithium metal anodes impedance measurements in symmetrical lithium cells (Li<jats:sup>0</jats:sup>|LE|LPCL|LE|Li<jats:sup>0</jats:sup>) were undertaken. In this case galvanostatic impedance spectroscopy (GEIS) with an applied current density of \u00b10.4 mA cm<jats:sup>-2 </jats:sup>was used to probe the changes in resistance contributions in the system over the period of stripping (positive current) and plating (negative current). For cells with just SE a large change in the resistance owing to the electrochemical reaction (ECR) (Li<jats:sup>0</jats:sup> \u2194 Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> + e<jats:sup>-</jats:sup>) occurred during stripping and plating indicating the dynamic nature of the ionic contact at the interface. For the hybrid electrolyte cells, this ECR resistance is decreased and becomes more stable however a larger interphase resistance is present. This resistance is a combination of the resistances of both the SLEI (the interphase between the LE and SE) and the SEI (the interphase between LE and Li anode) and it changes over stripping and plating showing that the S(L)EIs which are present are dynamic. Finally, post-mortem SEM/EDX of the surface of samples show a change in morphology and the presence of decomposition products from both the liquid and solid electrolytes. These studies show that the LPCL-BMPipTFSI hybrid is stable and improve ionic contact at the lithium metal anode interface. Further testing in half Li-S cells will determine the suitability of the use of the ionic liquid at the cathode side of the cell.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] J.

However, the enormous challenges, such as uncontrollable lithium deposition, side reaction, infinite volume change and dendrite generation, hinders its application. To address these problems, the deposition behavior of lithium must be exactly controlled and the anode/electrolyte interface must be stabilized. The deposition of lithium is a multi-step process influenced by multi-physical fields, where nucleation is the key to final morphology. Hence, increasing investigations have focused on the employment of lithiophilic materials that can regulate lithium nucleation in recent years. The lithiophilic materials introduced into the deposition hosts or solid electrolyte interphases can regulate the nucleation overpotential and facilitate uniform deposition. However, the concept of lithiophilicity is still undefined and the mechanism is still unrevealed. In this review, the recent advances in the regulation mechanisms of lithiophilicity are discussed, and the applications of lithiophilic materials in hosts and protective interphases are summarized.

Experiments suggest that filaments grow by extrusion of metal from the substrate, due to compressive stress introduced during deposition. A model is presented that explores the origin of stress generated in the anode during plating-stripping cycles. According to the model, plating or stripping reactions insert or remove lithium atoms at the interface between the metal and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Stress is induced by the resulting diffusion processes, with diffusion-induced strain accommodated by inelastic creep. Stress distributions during cycling are calculated, and are used in turn to predict curvature transients that would be measured in beam-deflection experiments. The calculations account for the three-dimensional surface morphology, since surface features that protrude above the surface plane do not contribute to curvature changes. Comparisons with recent curvature measurements demonstrate detailed agreement, with diffusion and creep parameters close to literature values.

Recently, various additives have been investigated to form a stable SEI layer on Li metal. However, during repetitive charge and discharge process, the additives in the electrolyte can be depleted by continuously forming SEI, which results in capacity fading of batteries. In this work, we developed the polymer protection layer containing excessive amount of additives that form the stable SEI layer. The additives can be stored in the polymeric layer, continuously released to the electrolyte during the repeated cycling. Electrochemical analyses such as linear sweep voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry were investigated, and the Li/Li symmetric cells showed the regulation of lithium deposition with small overpotential. The cycling performance of lithium metal batteries with protection layer was evaluated with high nickel NCM cathode.    </jats:p>"}

However, the safety issue caused by the inhomogeneous Li deposition and Li dendrite growth greatly limits their commercial application. Several methods have been proposed to address this issue. On the one hand, when Li ions are released from one electrode and consumed at the other electrode, it causes a salt concentration gradient. Besides, the electrical migration of anions in the opposite direction aggravates the concentration of gradient since anions do not react at the electrodes. Fast dendritic growth then occurs when the current is high enough to fully deplete the Li+ ion at the anode during charge. Thus, suppressing concentration gradient by immobilizing the anions would in principle solve the fast dendritic growth issue. On the other hand, the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) plays a crucial role in the operation of Li metal batteries since it prevents further reduction and continuous electrolyte reaction. SEI derives from the passivation layer formed onto the surface of Li metal under dry air during lithium foil extrusion and then evolves further in contact with the electrolytes and during subsequent electrochemical Li stripping/plating. The SEI is inhomogeneous and since it contains lower resistance pathways for Li+ transport, it favors inhomogeneous deposition at any current. Thus, SEI engineering, in order to favor the homogeneity of current density and enhanced mechanical properties to confine lithium could, in principle, improve the performance of Li metal batteries.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Thus, we studied the use of single-ion conducting polymers with high cationic transference numbers (tLi<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> close to 1) as artificial SEIs (art-SEIs) since they include immobile anions and thus prevent Li+ depletion during charge and, at the same time, improve lithium metal confinement and the homogeneity of current density. Our results show much improved homogeneity of Li deposition and cycling stability after single-ion art-SEI coating using an ether-based liquid electrolyte combined with a separator. Nevertheless, it could not enable long-term cycling as the separator does not enable homogeneous pressure and current density onto the lithium anode. Thus, the use of a single-ion conducting solid polymer electrolyte was combined with a single-ion conducting art-SEI (as illustrated in Figure 1). This strategy allows the suppression of salt concentration gradients, inhomogeneous pressure and current density, thus enables homogeneous Li deposition and long-term cycling of Li metal anode.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"651fig1.jpg\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>"}

The effects of key physical factors such as ambient temperature, solid electrolyte Young\u2019s modulus and external stress on dendrite growth and their acting principles are discussed and analyzed. The results show that under the conditions of high temperature, high solid electrolyte Young\u2019s modulus and external stress, the growth of lithium dendrites is slow, the number of long dendrites is small, and the electrodeposition is more uniform. In addition, the effects of Young\u2019s modulus of solid electrolyte and ambient temperature on the growth of lithium dendrites in a common range are compared with each other.

Herein, a space\u2010confined strategy is proposed to realize stable Li metal anode by constructing a nonplanar interface with flexible tent\u2010like nanocavities. The tent\u2010like interface is achieved through the self\u2010assembly of graphene oxide on zinc nanosheets, accompanied by the spontaneous formation of Zn\uf8ffO\uf8ffC bond. Remarkably, the Zn\uf8ffO\uf8ffC bond immobilizes the graphene oxide layer to ensure tent\u2010like structural integrity, and shows excellent lithophilicity to induce homogeneous lithium deposition within nanocavities. Furthermore, the process of Li plating/stripping is confined inside tent\u2010like nanocavities to effectively decrease electrolyte content contact with fresh Li, which reduces hazardous electrolyte\u2010lithium reaction and thus eliminates continuous consumption of Li metal. Consequently, the symmetrical cells with the tent\u2010like interface deliver excellent long cycling performance over 1600\u00a0h at 1\u00a0mA\u00a0cm<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup>, and full batteries show high\u2010capacity retention of 94.6% after 3000 cycles at 5\u00a0C.

However, they can fail catastrophically due to dendritic nucleation, growth, and penetration through the polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene (PE) separators. Poor electrolyte wetting and non-uniform Li ion flux are known to affect Li dendrite formation, especially since the PP/PE separators have non-uniform pore size distribution and typical organic electrolytes do not wet them well. In this work, we demonstrate that a porous zeolite coating on a commercial PP separator can improve electrolyte wettability and through plane ionic conductivity, giving rise to more uniform Li flux. Consequently, coated separator can delay dendrite penetration and enhance cell performance and safety. We tested Celgard 2400 (uncoated) and zeolite-coated separator (coated) in high energy NMC<jats:bold>||</jats:bold>Li cells for their rate capability and cycle life performance. Rate capability test for these cells shows that the additional resistance due to the zeolite coating can negatively impact the cell performance at high C-rates. However, cells with the coated separator outperform those with uncoated separator in the cycle life test with improved capacity retention. Symmetric cell studies performed to understand the differences in Li plating morphology indicate initial lower overpotential for the coated separator cells, revealing improved electrolyte wetting and relatively uniform Li flux. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals zeolite-coating microstructure with evenly distributed zeolite particles and cycled Li metal electrode morphologies. SEM images show much smoother Li plating morphology on Li metal surface in the cells with coated separators. This study highlights the potential of using zeolite-coated separators to enhance lithium metal battery (LMB) performance and safety.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n                  \n               </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>"}

Fine tuning the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is critical for the practical implementation of liquid lithium metal batteries [2]. The presence of particular SEI species are hypothesized to improve the coulombic efficiency and mitigate dendrite formation for enhanced lifetime and safety, respectively [2]. Recently, Zhang et al. developed a novel in-situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy method to reveal electrolyte oxidation via carbonate dehydrogenation on Ni-based oxides in Li-ion batteries [3]. We leverage this technique and apply it to the Cu side in a Li || Cu battery to probe SEI growth and evolution. In this study, we systematically change the salt, solvent and additive components of the electrolyte and monitor the organic and inorganic SEI species that form under different electrochemical conditions. Furthermore, we directly correlate the chemical composition of the SEI to cell-level coulombic efficiency [4]. Complimentary characterization techniques will be used to further resolve the chemical structure of the SEI. Finally, results from this study will help generate descriptors for the rationale design of new electrolytes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>1.

This is also true for all\u2010solid\u2010state batteries (ASSBs), for which dendrite formation has been observed particularly at high stack pressures and high current densities. An evolving and very promising strategy for suppressing dendrite formation is the usage of a thin carbon layer on the anode side, referred to as deposition\u2010type lithium metal anode. Here, it is shown that for ASSBs with carbon\u2010based deposition\u2010type anodes of this type, the discharge capacity can be significantly increased by either: i) active stack pressure control; or by ii) hot pressing of binder\u2010containing anode and separator.

For this, LIB pouch cells (NMC622||graphite, 5 Ah) were aged for 400 full cycles at 20 \u00b0C or 60 \u00b0C.

While the interphases did not notably increase in thickness with aging, the surface area of both electrodes increased, leading to more electrolyte decomposition and larger lithium loss.

Keeping in mind the necessity for greener materials in future energy storage solutions, in this work an innovative lithium protective membrane is prepared based on chitosan, a polysaccharide obtained from the deacetylation reaction of chitin. Chitosan was methacrylated through a simple, one-step reaction in water and then cross-linked by UV-induced radical polymerization.

Moreover, in long cycling conditions, the protected lithium cell performed more than 40 cycles at 0.1 mA cm\u22122, at a fixed capacity of 0.5 mAh cm\u22122, retaining 100% coulombic efficiency, which is more than twice the lifespan of the bare lithium cell.</jats:p>"}

Lithium-ion-based batteries are already well-established and are considered the main chemistries to power current EVs. However, limited specific energy (&lt; 300 Wh/kg) prevents these batteries from having high mileage vehicles. Lithium-sulfur batteries are considered the most promising next-generation energy storage system as they high theoretical capacity (~1675 mAhg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>), low cathode materials cost, and cell energy densities that can exceed 700 Wh/kg [1,2]. However, some major drawbacks prevent the Li-S battery system from being applicable in energy devices and hinder its commercialization, that include low power density and rapid capacity degradation during their cycling life. In addition, the lithium metal anode in Li-S batteries bring various issues to the forefront such as continuous solid electrolyte interface growth, dendrite formation, and loss of active lithium and electrolyte. These issues are further exacerbated at high C-rates which increases the possibility of an internal short-circuit and sudden cell failure [3]. In order to promote longer life cycles and prevent sudden cell failure, a thorough understanding of the cell\u2019s electrochemical behavior is crucial for the development of a stable and practical Li-S battery system. The introduction of oxide fillers such TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, etc. has been previously studied in various lithium-ion systems and has been shown to improve the cell\u2019s lithium-ion transport properties, which in turn improve the performance of Li-S cells [4]. When used as interlayers they can also trap soluble polysulfides diffusing out of the cathode and reduce their crossover to the anode which helps reduce the shuttle effect of said polysulfides.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In the present study, the use of a polysulfide immobilizing system to reduce sulfur loss and improve capacity retention has been demonstrated. The galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling study shows that cells retain higher capacity during the course of cycling. The initial capacity for Li-S cells with the filler average 1300+ mAh/g (C/10) while the capacity stabilizes around 1000 mAh/g after 3 cycles (C/5). The capacity retention at C/5 after 75 cycles was approximately 875 mAh/g which represents a rate 0.17% drop per cycle. When compared to control cells, the cells containing no fillers had lower initial capacity that averaged 1050 mAh/g and that rapidly declined to stabilize around 650 mAh/g. However, after this major drop, the cells remained stable no with measurable drop after 75 cycles. The behavior indicates that the cells with fillers delayed the effect of sulfur loss experienced in cells without fillers; however, the slow capacity drop that ensued, indicates that while polysulfide trapping was efficient it was unable to fully prevent it. The effect of fillers on the Coulombic efficiency (CE) also supports the polysulfide \u201ctrapping\u201d mechanism and shows the ability of the cell to reduce the shuttle effect that contributes to lower CE values. Further electrochemical studies have been performed to understand the mechanisms of the improvement of the cell.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] A.

The phenomena lead to degradation in performance, impose operation restrictions and potentially make devices unsafe.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Solid-state, lithium-metal-based, batteries show promise to meet electric vehicle market requirements, but technical challenges to overcome rapid degradation and cost-effective processing remains. Cathode/electrolyte interfacial side reactions can lead to passivating layer formation, thus increasing cell resistance, unwanted additional overvoltage, and ultimately capacity loss. These phenomena are exacerbated in solid-to-solid contact between solid state electrolytes, active materials, and electronic conductive agents. Therefore, electrode manufacturing design is required to mitigate these issues.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Within this work we have evaluated Spray Drying (SD) and Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) coating processes to engineer the cathode/ electrolyte interface of SSBs, thus improving performance and overall cell cycle life. Cathode materials coating is utilised as an effective strategy to mitigate the degradation of the interface. SD is classically utilised in the food and pharma industries, and it has recently been expanded to include the synthesis/shaping of battery electrode materials as a versatile and robust methodology that can be easily scaled up. ALD is a widely exploited technique in the semiconductor (SC) industry based on self-limiting chemical reactions to deposit stoichiometrically-fixed, defect-free and nanometric-thick materials on surfaces. As such, the application of ALD to coat powders in the battery community is innovative and currently under development.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Cathodic materials such as NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxides) have been investigated, as the need for improving the capacity retention is strong for high-content (&gt;80%) nickel cathodes. Indeed, ALD utilised to coat NMC powder provides a nanometric thick layer of a dielectric but ionic conductive metal oxide. Optimisation of aluminium oxide shell on a core of polycrystalline high nickel material has been investigated with surface engineering. In parallel, we have been exploring the benefit of SD to create an NMC811 powder showing a decorated structure using two different approaches. Indeed, we have either used preformed metal oxide nanoparticles dispersed in an NMC suspension or synthesised a metal oxide layer on top of the NMC in-situ by a chemical reaction during the spray process.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Morphological and chemical characterisation of the products have been crucial to develop the coating processes.

However, this promising system still suffers from huge discharge/charge overpotentials and poor cycling stability, which are related to the leakage/volatilization of organic liquid electrolytes and the inefficiency of solid catalysts. A mixing ionic liquid-based gel polymer electrolyte (IL-GPE)-based Li-O2 battery, consisting of a 20 mM 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DBBQ) 40 mM N-methylphenothiazine (MPT)-containing IL-GPE and a single-walled carbon nanotube cathode, is designed for the first time here. This unique dual redox mediators-based GPE, which contains a polymer matrix immersed with mixed ionic liquid electrolyte, provides a proper ionic conductivity (0.48 mS cm\u22121) and effective protection for lithium anode. In addition, DBBQ, as the catalyst for an oxygen reduction reaction, can support the growth of discharge products through the solution\u2013phase pathway. Simultaneously, MPT, as the catalyst for an oxygen evolution reaction, can decompose Li2O2 at low charge overpotentials. Hence, the DBBQ-MPT-IL-GPE-based Li-O2 battery can operate for 100 cycles with lower charge/discharge overpotentials. This investigation may offer a promising method to realize high-efficiency Li-O2/air batteries.</jats:p>"}

The benefits of lithium-sulfur batteries have led to widespread efforts to understand the fundamentals of the sulfur redox chemistry that drives their operation, as capacity fade has been observed in almost all Li-S batteries.<jats:sup>[1]</jats:sup> Therefore, the involved local structural changes that correlate with the (electro)chemical processes need to be unveiled during the operation of Li-S batteries, suitably by <jats:italic>in situ </jats:italic>and <jats:italic>in operando</jats:italic> methods.

Studies have proven that modulating the composition and structure of SEI films by using electrolyte additives is a convenient and valid method.

Compared with inorganic solid electrolytes, solid polymer electrolytes have better flexibility, machinability, and more importantly, better contact with the electrode, and low interfacial impedance.

In this regard, the ASSB technology is considered superior, especially if the incorporation of the lithium metal anode, or other high-capacity anode materials like silicon is achieved. However, these systems still require intensive research as many physical effects, especially those concerning the interaction of electrochemistry and solid mechanics, are to date not well understood [1]. Most experimental investigations on ASSB cells are performed on laboratory scale and are usually operated at elevated mechanical pre-stress to obtain satisfactory system performance. The delamination of active materials and solid electrolyte during cycling is expected to be one of the key effects for the required mechanical pre-stress. Furthermore, a lot of experimental research focuses on the development of new material classes and their stability in the cell compound, while a systematic optimization of the cell setup is missing.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Comprehensive computational models can help to generate insights in these regards as they allow for detailed investigations of local effects, which is often not possible in experimental setups. Another advantage of computational models compared to experiments is the ability to change input parameters in a fast and systematic way to quantify their influence on the battery cell performance and thereby help to speed up the optimization of battery designs. Since the multitude of physical effects that are relevant in ASSB are computationally challenging, a lot of modeling approaches rely on numerous simplifications like spatial homogenization or neglect of mechanical effects to name just two. However, such assumptions can significantly limit the validity of the model.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We propose a novel computational model for ASSB [2] to thoroughly investigate the interdependence of electrochemistry and solid mechanics on resolved microstructures that vastly influence the behavior and the performance of an ASSB cell. It is based on nonlinear continuum mechanics and accounts for large deformations due to lithiation dependent volume changes of the active materials. The mass and charge conservations are consistently formulated to also ensure the conservation property in large deformation scenarios. Furthermore, the model is extended by interaction effects of electrochemistry and solid mechanics like a nonlinear contact formulation at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces to account for delamination phenomena and the subsequent absence of charge transfer reaction (see Fig. 1). We thereby show how delamination phenomena drastically change available percolation paths in the microstructure. The efficient parallel implementation of the computational model allows to investigate realistic three-dimensionally resolved microstructures of ASSB cells while accounting for the coupling effects of electrochemistry and solid mechanics. A combination of elaborate physical models and probabilistic methods enables to gain further understanding and to quantify main influencing factors on the cell performance. To showcase these capabilities and how they can be exploited to increase system understanding, we analyze how statistical values like the porosity, or the composition of the electrode microstructure influence the capacity of an ASSB cell and thereby contribute to find optimal electrode designs.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1]: J.

In addition, Sulfur is one of the most abundant materials in nature and moreover, a non-toxic element which makes the lithium sulfur battery a suitable candidate for commercialization. However, obstacles to overcome include the loss of active sulfur due to various phenomena mainly represented by polysulfide diffusion and reactivity on the lithium anode. Another serious issue observed in so many ways is the low electronic conductivity of Sulfur and its products such as Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S as a result of cycling. These problems are often exacerbated at higher sulfur loading and lower electrolyte to sulfur ratios (E/S). One way to increase the sulfur loading is to increase the thickness of the cathode which in return increases the risk of low utilization of active material because of the high thickness and low wettability by electrolyte. Another way is to increases the ratio of the sulfur in respect to conductive host material without increasing the thickness of the cathode. By doing so, sulfur is going to fill all the pores existing in the host material and therefore, this structure cannot provide enough volume expansion during discharge process and as a result, the cathode structure may collapse and the whole cell fail. Therefore, to come up with a high performance and stable battery during cycling, there is no doubt that we have to focus on the structure of the cathode and the host material to effectively confine the sulfur and produced polysulfide and at the same time, alleviate the way of the electron transfer through the conductive network.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this research, we investigate some of the most influential parameters mainly associated with the morphology of the cathode to improve capacity retention.

In addition, various electrochemical testing to evaluation the loss of activity of the cathode surface is also carried it to correlate to the proposed physical model.    </jats:p>"}

Here, the aligned and open microchannel structures of wood are fabricated as separators to provide low\u2010tortuosity pathways for rapid ionic transport and serve as reservoirs for retaining the electrolyte by capillary forces to improve the electrochemical kinetics. In an open environment, the wood separator can hold 39% of the initial adsorption electrolyte capacity after 40 days, much higher than that of glass fiber (GF, 15%). The cellulose in the wood can confine the crossover effect of water thereby inhibiting the corrosion of lithium anode and reducing the deposition of by\u2010products.

However, several critical challenges for Li metal originate from its highly reactive nature and the hostless reaction of deposition and stripping impede the practical use of Li metal as an anode. The role of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is very important for the Li metal anode where the SEI must protect the dynamically changing surface of the Li metal. Since the SEI\u2010generating reaction mechanisms for the two different electrolyte systems, liquid and solid, are considerably different, the SEI layers formed between the Li metal and the electrolytes in the two electrolyte systems have substantially different properties, causing different interfacial issues. Inhibition of the interfacial problems requires different strategies to reinforce the SEI layer for each of the electrolyte systems. However, the differences in the two electrolyte systems have not been clearly compared in the prior literature. In this report, the interfacial issues for the two different electrolyte systems are compared and different strategies for SEI modification are provided to overcome the issues.</jats:p>"}

However, it is found that these results are not all reliable, as a misconception of electrode performance can be caused once the electrolyte is chemically unstable. As a paradigm, it is demonstrated that the diethyl carbonate (DEC) solvent can chemically react with lithium metal to form insoluble and soluble by\u2010products, which can accumulate on the lithium anode to influence the lithium potential and/or migrate to the counter electrode to proceed with the uncompleted electrochemical reactions. The resultant voltage\u2010capacity profile cannot reflect the actual electrode performance, such as the lithium storing capability within the graphite. The reason for this phenomenon is elucidated based on solvation chemistry, particularly the mechanism of mitigating it by introducing ethylene carbonatesolvent to form new hydrogen bonds. The viewpoint is further verified by employing the full cell and also extended in sodium and potassium batteries. This study shows the necessity of discerning the reliability of electrode performance and also sheds light on the importance of designing a compatible electrolyte to examine electrode performance.</jats:p>"}

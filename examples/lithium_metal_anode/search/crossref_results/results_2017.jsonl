However, uncontrolled dendritic Li growth (continuous loss of Li) and limited Coulombic efficiency (CE) during Li deposition/stripping of a bulk Li anode, are the main reasons behind low cycle life, which has limited their practical applications [1,2]. Although low CE can be partially compensated by an excess amount of Li, it is achieved at the expense of lower useable Li energy density and elevated risks of fire and other hazards associated with Li. Therefore, efforts should be directed to reduce the use of Li, limited in weight to balance cathode capacity. For example in an effort to balance the sulfur (S)-cathode capacity with Li-anode capacity, we recently demonstrated that 20 \u00b5m thick Li can replace 380 \u00b5m thick Li and achieve better CE (Figure 1 (a)). </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Furthermore, the rate of dendrite growth gets amplified when the cell is cycled at high charge-discharge current densities, high charge voltages, and high areal discharge currents. Increasing anode surface area would reduce the effective charge/discharge current densities. We have shown that a 20 mm thick Li deposited on Cu current collector (CC) using thermal evaporation technique showed particulate morphology (high surface area) compared to featureless (low surface area) morphology of commonly used thick Li (Figure 1 (b)) that may have provided improved results as shown in Figure 1 (a). However, with increased surface area, more surface of thin Li is expected to be exposed to electrolytes or catholytes (especially in Li-S battery), and thus react faster than bulk Li causing cell performance degradation during long-term battery cycling. To reduce the high reactivity of thermally evaporated thin film Li, we will apply an artificial SEI (ASEI) consisting of a conducting polymer (poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/fullerene (PCBM)/graphite layer developed at UDRI [3]. In thick Li metal based LIB, we have demonstrated that this ASEI as Li protective layer remarkably reduces dendrite growth, enhances cycle life more than 300% and protects Li by physically separating it from the electrolyte (Figure 1 (c)). The protected Li anode may be incorporated into wet cell batteries or solid state batteries having transition metal oxide cathodes (specifically, state-of-the-art Li-ion cathodes), sulfur cathode (Li-S battery), or oxygen cathode (Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> battery).

The charge/discharge process was divided into four stages (i.e., A, B, C, and D) based on the relation between state-of-voltage and damages. AE Signals in each stage were successfully detected and correlated with the damage mechanism. The AE time-domain characteristics (i. e., waveform, amplitude, and duration) in each stage were similar. On the other hand, AE signal could be classified into two distinct groups (i.e., high and low frequency) on basis of the frequency characteristic. Stages containing high-frequency components of 250-300 kHz were related with cracking phenomenon, while low-frequency AE signals in different stage were emitted from SEI layer formation.

In recent years, the emergence of gel polymer electrolytes (GPE) based on ionic liquid solvent opened up an avenue for safer solid-state battery technology due to the nonflammability nature of the liquid. These type of GPEs consist of a liquid electrolyte solvent with lithium salt and a polymer<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. Addition of fillers in GPEs have been shown to improve both ionic conductivity and mechanical properties of the composite electrolyte<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. In this work, we are reporting a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) which was synthesized by blending of a polymerized ionic liquid (PIL) based on pyrrolidinium cation, an imidazolium cation based ionic liquid and lithium salt. Later on, the effect of addition of certain percentages of inorganic silica fillers in GPE were observed by performing both electrochemical and thermal analysis of the polymer electrolyte and their applicability in Li batteries. The prepared GPEs and the composite GPEs (CGPE) were free standing and mechanically stable. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to measure and compare the room temperature ionic conductivity of the GPEs and CGPEs. Chronoamperometry tests were also performed to observe the lithium ion transference number of both type of electrolytes. Almost a two-fold increase in ionic conductivity and ~10% increase in lithium ion transference number was observed for CGPE compared to GPE. This may be the cause of improved ion conduction pathways for lithium ions due to the addition of inorganic silica fillers. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed to observe the thermal stability of the electrolytes and it has been observed that both the electrolytes were thermally stable upto 390<jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C. The electrolytes also possess high electrochemical stability window (~ 5V vs Li/Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>) which indicates their good affinity of the PIL, Ionic Liquid, Lithium salt and the fillers. The chemical stability of the electrolytes against lithium anode were evaluated and compared with the ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) by performing EIS of Li/GPE or CGPE or ILE/Li symmetric cells at different storage time under open circuit condition at room temperature. The growth rate of interfacial resistances in terms of storage time is significantly lower for both the GPE and CGPE compared to ILE system. To observe the electrochemical stability of the electrolytes, galvanostatic cycling tests were performed on Li/Li symmetric cells at high current densities. It has been observed that both the electrolytes have lower and stable overpotential compared to ILE which is indicative of uniform lithium deposition on both GPE and CGPE. The electrochemical results obtained in this study, indicate that the CGPE are expected to perform as solid-state composite electrolyte in new generation lithium batteries. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References: </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>1.

However, there are still critical bottlenecks for fabrication of a commercial Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> battery. The cyclability of Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> battery is very poor compared to lithium-ion battery. The main reasons for this problem are a variety of side reactions during the battery operation, which inactivate the lithium anode and cathode catalyst. To solve this problem, reversible charge/discharge reactions should be presented. During discharge reaction of Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> battery, various superoxide and peroxide species, such as O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n                  <jats:sup>-</jats:sup>, LiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> appear. These nucleophilic molecules could react with electrolyte and carbon electrode. A dominant portions of side-reactions originate from this process. Therefore, we adopted a catalyst support with surface oxygen-defects to stabilize the nucleophilic molecules. In this study, we used zirconia as a support and observed that electrocatalyst with zirconia support exhibits better cyclability compared to that without support. Experimental and computational approaches are exploited to understand this phenomenon and we found that the reactivity of superoxide and peroxide species decrease with the oxygen-defective support. Our concept proposed in this study could be the clue for the design of cathode catalyst for reversible charge/discharge reactions. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>   </jats:p>"}

The stress arises from gradients in the lithium concentration that lead to the formation of eigenstrains.

The model solves for the mechanical equilibrium of the layer, with the anisotropic linear elasticity tensor as well as the concentration-dependent anisotropic eigenstrain in the material based on the steady-state concentration profile. The von Mises stress is calculated as a function of the anisotropic properties and applied current. This stress can be compared to the yield stress of the protective layer material to determine whether it is sufficiently robust for many charge/discharge cycles of the lithium metal anode. The presented work will cover a range of cases from single-crystal domains to polycrystalline films with varying levels of anisotropy.

It is also important as an anode in Li-S and Li-air batteries in the innovative batteries in the future. Dendrite formation is a serious problem in cycleability and safety for lithium metal anode. Lithium dendrites are formed by (1) inhomogeneous thickness of the SEI formed on lithium metal, (3) local current concentration to the edges of deposited lithium, (3) excess nucleation during deposition, etc. Concentrated electrolyte solutions have attracted attention as electrolytes for LIBs because they have many unique characteristics [1-4]. We have so far investigated concentrated electrolyte systems that are stable against 5 V-class spinal LiNi<jats:sub>0.5</jats:sub>Mn<jats:sub>1.5</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> cathode [5-7]. It has been reported that the use of concentrated LiFSI/tetraglyme (G4) effectively suppress lithium dendrite formation [8]. Unfortunately ether compounds cannot be used for even 4 V-class positive electrodes such as LCO, NCA, and NMC. In this study, we investigated several concentrated systems using carbonate-based solutions to suppress the dendritic growth of lithium during electrochemical deposition. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A thin layer of Au (ca. 30 nm) was deposited on Cu foil and used as a working electrode. Nearly saturated 7.8, 10, and 3.9 mol kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> solutions were prepared using PC, DMC, and EC+DEC (1:1 by volume) as solvents and LiFSI was used as an electrolyte.\u00a01 M solutions (0.83, 0.93, and 0.86 mol kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>, respectively) were also used for comparison. A coin-type three electrode cell was constructed using Li foil as a counter and a reference electrode. Lithium was deposited at a current density of 0.1 or 1.0 mA cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> for 10 h, and then dissolved at the same current density to a cut-off voltage of 1.0 V. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1 shows SEM images of the electrode surfaces after the first lithium deposition. Dendrites were observed in each 1 M solution, but their formation was remarkably suppressed in each concentrated solution. These facts clearly show that the use of concentrated solution is effective for suppressing lithium dendrite formation. Figure 2 compares SEM images of the cross-sections of the electrodes after the 1<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> and 11<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> deposition in the concentrated solutions. The particle size of the deposited lithium was larger in 7.8 mol kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> PC and 10 mol kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> DMC solutions than in 3.9 mol kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> EC+DEC after the first deposition, and increased further after the 11<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> deposition. The high concentration seems to be effective for suppressing excess nucleation and enhancing the particle growth of lithium. In 3.9 mol kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> EC+DEC solution, the thickness of the lithium layer was thin after the first deposition, but increased significantly after the 11<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> deposition. Probably a large amount of decomposition products of the solvent was deposited in the gaps of lithium metal. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 3 shows coulombic efficiencies for lithium deposition/dissolution cycles in 1 M solutions and 7.8, 10 and 3.9 mol kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> solutions of LiFSI dissolved in PC, DMC, and EC+DEC (1:1). The coulombic efficiency was low in 1 M PC and DMC solutions, but increased significantly in 7.8 mol kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> PC and 10 mol kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> DMC solutions. It was high even in 1 M EC+DEC solution and slightly increased in the 3.9 mol kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> solution. The average coulombic efficiencies for the 10 cycles were 84.0%, 92.6% and 96.8% in 7.8 mol kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> PC, 10 mol kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> DMC and 3.9 mol kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> EC+DEC, respectively. The EC+DEC solution gave the highest coulombic efficiency, which is due to the formation of an effective SEI layer formed by the decomposition of EC. Unfortunately the solubility of LiFSI in EC+DEC is low (3.9 mol kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>), which did not effectively suppress the excess nucleation as shown in Fig. 2. More concentrated EC-based solution will suppress the dendrite formation and give a high coulombic efficiency. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This work was supported by NEDO, Japan. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>References</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] S.-K.

Although near-theoretical capacity (~515 mAh\u00b7g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) has been achieved for the first discharge, capacity greatly decreases with every cycle thereafter.

The lack of reversible capacity in CuF<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> may be due to irreversible crystal structure changes inside of cathode which inhibit delithiation upon charging or due to the loss of copper through the electrolyte. Evidence for the latter for this can be seen through the copper plating of the lithium metal anode after cycling, detected by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis, or through the decrease in copper peak intensity in X-ray diffraction (XRD) and EDS spectra of the cathodes upon recharging. Correlation of copper content to capacity suggests that copper loss from the cathode is not the only factor in capacity loss and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging shows large morphological differences between a pristine and charged sample.

In combination with the natural abundance, low cost and environmental friendliness of sulfur, the Li-S battery becomes a promising candidate for the next generation power source. However\uff0cthe commercialization of Li-S battery is inhibited by the insulating nature of sulfur and Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S, the volume expansion, \u201cShuttle effect\u201d caused by the high solubility of lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte, the severe corrosion of lithium anode and irreversible reaction during the charge/discharge process, which lead to a low utilization rate of sulfur, serious capacity fading, and low Coulombic efficiency of Li-S battery. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>One of the most effective ways to circumvent these three limitations is to fabricate sulfur/carbon composite cathodes by incorporating sulfur within a variety of carbon materials including porous carbons, carbon nanotubes, graphene nanosheets and many other forms. These carbon hosts can enhance the conductivity of sulfur electrodes and accommodate their volume changes. Furthermore, the weak interactions between carbon and polysulfides also alleviate the dissoluble loss of polysulfide intermediates. In particular, hierarchically porous carbon materials are recently receiving discernable attention. It is believed that the micropores enable better cycle stability due to solvent-restricted lithiation/delithiation of sulfur, while the larger pores (mesopores and macropores) promise high sulfur loading and rapid ion transport. Therefore, both of large capacity and high rate performance may be achieved. Further, the nitrogen doping of carbon materials has been recently demonstrated to be a powerful method for enhancing the overall electrochemical performance of sulfur cathodes. The nitrogen heteroatom with high electronegative improves the carbon conductivity and promotes chemical adsorption of polysulfides, resulting in enhanced sulfur utilization, rate capability, and cyclic stability. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>For these reasons, it is essential to develop facile and scalable methods to prepare nitrogen-doped carbon materials with hierarchical porosity. However, there is a trade-off between well-developed porosity and high nitrogen-doping level. Generally, current methods that favor high nitrogen contents tend to result in low specific surface area or small pore volume, or vice versa. To produce hierarchical porous carbon materials with both developed porosity and high nitrogen content, we herein introduce a simple and cost-efficient approach using two ease-to-scale-up steps including 1) one-pot aqueous self-assembly route to firstly get nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbons (NOMCs) and then 2) ammonia activation treatment to achieve desirable porosity and nitrogen-doping. For comparison, another important and industrial method, KOH activation, was also used to obtain hierarchically porous carbon. Those gained carbons were then used as the sulfur hosts in the Li-S batteries. The effect of activation conditions on the nitrogen content, specific surface area, and pore size distribution of the hierarchically porous carbons as well as their electrochemical performance were investigated in detail. It clearly exhibits that ammonia activation enables the hierarchically porous carbon with relatively high porosity (specific surface area up to 1565 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> g<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>) and nitrogen content (up to 4.4 wt%). These combined superior properties make them good candidates as the host materials of sulfur cathodes in Li-S batteries with high sulfur loading.  </jats:p>"}

However, NASA\u2019s future missions, e.g., Astronaut\u2019s Portable Life Support System (PLSS) for Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVA), small planetary rovers, planetary probes, CubeSats etc., require battery technologies with higher specific energies and energy densities, for short cyclic lifetimes. Similarly, DoD is interested in the development of a high energy rechargeable battery system for soldier applications. The lithium/sulfur system is deemed the most viable future technology, because of its high theoretical specific energy (3-4x vs Li-ion). Despite several years of development, this system hasn\u2019t matured yet, mainly due to the challenges from the soluble polysulfides, which results in a \u2018redox shuttle\u2019 and a deposition of lihium sulfides and impedance growth at the lithium anode. Several attempts were reported in the literature with novel cathode designs, e.g., hierarchical porous carbon structures to sequester sulfur and its reduction products, and also with electrolyte solutions to minimize their solubility.<jats:sup> 1-3</jats:sup> Good cycle life was achieved in some of these cases with nanostructured sulfur cathodes in both organic electrolytes containing suitable additives (LiNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) and in ionic liquids, but the sulfur loadings in the cathodes are much lower (below 4 mg/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) than desired. For example, to realize high specific energy from a Li/S cell, sulfur loading will need to be high, i.e., &gt; 12 mg/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> per side or &gt;6 mAh/cm<jats:sup>2 </jats:sup>areal capacity. Recently, our group<jats:sup>4,5</jats:sup> and several others<jats:sup>6-8</jats:sup> have been developing new sulfur composite cathodes blended with transition metal sulfides (e.g., titanium and molybdenum disulfide), which not only provide good electronic and ionic conductivity, but assist in the trapping of polysulfides within the cathode. We have demonstrated that MoS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> doesn\u2019t undergo a redox transition, unlike TiS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, and yet provides similar benefits. In addition, we have demonstrated similar improvement in the cycle life of sulfur cathodes with a thin coating of a metal sulfide. In this paper, we will describe our studies with high-areal-capacity sulfur cathodes blended or coated with new metal sulfides, demonstrating their performance and understanding their mechanism. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:italic>\u00a0</jats:italic>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:italic>Acknowledgements</jats:italic>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The work described here was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and supported by US Army-CERDEC. <jats:list list-type=\"simple\">\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>Y.

Recently, rechargeable batteries using zinc metal anode have been investigated extensively. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>However, an important barrier of the Zn-based batteries is the poor cycle life, which mainly derives from the drawbacks of the Zn metal anode and the electrolyte. The cyclability of the traditional alkaline Zn-based batteries is mainly restricted by dendrite growth, high solubility of discharge product (i.e. zincate) in the electrolytes, water loss from the liquid electrolyte, electrolyte depletion caused by the narrow electrochemical window. In most previous studies, the zinc-based aqueous batteries suffered from low columbic efficiency (CE) even using the high rate to minimize the side reaction, which means the Zn-based batteries usually require regular topping up with electrolyte.\u00a0Significant excessive zinc has to been used to keep the cycle stability, results in sub-optimal utilization of the zinc theoretical capacity, as in the case of the lithium metal anode. The goal of achieving high CE in aqueous zinc metal batteries remained allusive. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The poor reversibility and low CE of the Zn metal anode is closely related with the Zn (II) cation solvate structure in the aqueous electrolyte. The hydration effects of the Zn (II) cation in water is so significant that the zinc hydroxide is easily forms. The slight but non-ignorable water decomposition caused by the narrow stability window produces more hydroxyl ion and certainly aggravates the formation of zinc hydroxide. Zinc hydroxide converts into insoluble zinc oxide (ZnO) when the solubility limit of the hydroxide species is reached. Formation of solid ZnO can be a difficult process to reverse during recharge, as it relies on the resolubilization of the Zn species back into the electrolyte prior to reduction. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We report the development of a highly concentrated neutral electrolyte that alters Zn(II) solvation structure resulting in the dendrite-free plating of Zn metal with high CE. The suppression of the zinc hydration was achieved through the formation of [Zn-TFSI] solvation structure instead of the [Zn-6H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O]<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> solvation structure. The solvation structure change is ascribed to the introduction of the TFSI<jats:sup>-</jats:sup> anion, which has strong coordination to the Zn (II) cation in concentrated electrolytes. The solvation structure change was investigated via a combination of IR spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using polarizable force fields. We demonstrate an exceptional performance of zinc metal cells containing Zn-based aqueous electrolyte that delivered an unprecedented high practical energy density of 300Wh/kg (based on both the cathode and anode electrodes). This study opens an avenue for the highly efficient utilization of zinc metal electrodes for advanced energy storage applications while the fundamental knowledge gained can also be applied to other metal anodes.  </jats:p>"}

Although lithium metal is an attractive material with excellent theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh/g) and very redox potential (-3.04 V vs. strandard hydrogen electrode), it causes electrolyte leakage, combustion, and explosion problems due to dendrite growth. In the case of conventional liquid electrolytes, dendrites grow more freely and flammable organic solvents are used, making them unsuitable for use with lithium metal anodes. On the contrary, solid polymer electrolyte-based batteries have the advantage of being able to achieve higher energy density as well as better stability to lithium metal. However, the organic component of the solid polymer electrolyte is still flammable, and the polymer/ceramic composite material is also generally flammable, so the safety issue cannot be completely avoided. Here, we show that the addition of a flame retardant effectively reduces the flammability of solid polymer electrolytes. The solid electrolyte consisted of a combination of PEO and flame retardant DMMP, and the composed LFP/solid polymer electrolyte/Li cell exhibited improved cycle stability and ionic conductivity.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"2305fig1.jpg\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>"}

While the ideal diluent molecules used in LHCE should be miscible in electrolyte system, it should not solvate lithium-ion effectively. To date, systematic investigation to reveal the design rule of diluent molecules remain poorly investigated. In addition, the choice of diluents is largely limited to fluorinated organic molecules which are expensive and environmentally hazardous and unstable at the reductive potential.

These NFDs have the unique resonance structures which effectively delocalize the oxygen lone pair electrons and thus enhance non-solvating characteristics, confirmed by the \u03b2 value and the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. In addition, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies confirm that our NFDs remains stable and unreacted after long-term cycling. Finally, NFD-containing electrolytes achieve superior cyclability up to 1400 cycles, the record for LHCE to date.

Herein, we design a host of metal nitrides (Mo2N and WN heterostructures) nanoparticles capsulated in the hollow carbon nanospheres, which can accommodate Li metal to form a stable composite anode. The lithiophilic Mo2N guides uniform infusion and reduces the nucleation barriers of Li metal during electrochemical process. Note that the rigid WN matrix is uniformly composited with Mo2N, which can suppress the pulverization of Mo2N during the repeat Li plating/stripping, ensuring the stability of regulated deposition during long cycling. High mechanical strength, uniform surface potential distribution and good electrolyte wettability of the Li metal-based composite anode guarantee the rapid Li plating/stripping kinetics. Thus, the obtained composite anode can stably cycle 1400 h at 1 mA cm-2 and 1 mA h cm-2 in the symmetric battery. The assembled full cells with LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NCM811) also deliver high capacity retention under the high loading (8.6 mg cm-2) or lean electrolyte (2 \u03bcL mg-1) condition.

However, and regardless of the coupling cathode electrode, one of the main challenges before the practical application of LMBs comes down to engineering electrolyte formulations compatible with lithium metal to eliminate dendrite formation and the uncontrolled loss of electrolyte and active lithium by forming a robust, ionic-conductive, and electron insulating, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Any improvement of the electrolyte/lithium metal interface passes through a thorough understanding of the reaction mechanisms behind the electrolyte degradation and the subsequence formation of the SEI. Characterizing this interface via experimental techniques is a challenge because of its delicate nature and simultaneous presence of liquid and solid phases. Here, we successfully narrowed this gap via computational modeling by using a recently introduced hybrid ab initio and reactive molecular dynamics (HAIR) scheme that uses in sequence the ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and the reactive force field (ReaxFF) methods to extend the time window achievable with the AIMD method alone. We performed a series of HAIR calculations with multiple electrolytes formulations on a lithium metal slab (Li(100)) with varying electrolyte/anode (E/A) ratios to evaluate the impact of the lithium salt concentration, type of solvent, presence of a diluent, and lithium thickness on the rate of electrolyte depletion, lithium dissolution, and SEI morphology. It is found that increasing salt concentration in a LiFSI/DMC electrolyte from 1 to 5 and then to 10 M yields significant changes in SEI morphology. The 1 M electrolyte led to DMC degradation into -O-CH3 with no significant LiO formation. In contrast, the 5 and 10 M formulations evolved into an SEI structure dominated by continuous and stratified LiO and LiF phases.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Changes in the SEI morphology based on the E/A ratio for the 10 M LiFSI/DMC electrolyte revealed the existence of an intermediate E/A ratio leading to a more compact and more inorganic-rich SEI; the formed LiO phase density was higher than that in other ensembles representative of dry and flooded electrolyte operation conditions. Our third set of calculations focused on the effect of solvent chemistry. The 5 M LiFSI/DME electrolyte led to the formation of a LiO phase surrounded by some residual DME solvent; in this wetted SEI, the residual solvent provides diffusion channels for Li+ ions. Finally, we tested the impact of adding 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethylene 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) as a diluent into the electrolyte using a 1.3 M LIFSI:DMC:TTE (1:1.2:3 molar ratio) formulation. The TTE diluent showed decomposition and helped grow a LiF-dominated SEI film with a lower LiO/LiF phase ratio than the equivalent 5.0 M LiFSI/DMC formulation with no electrolyte. These results form the basis for a deeper understanding of the SEI formation mechanisms and provide a design guideline for SEI films based on the lithium salt concentration, relative electrolyte/electrode content, and presence of a diluent.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>1.

Introduction</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are rechargeable devices assembled with a sulfur cathode and a lithium metal anode. Li-S batteries have twice the volumetric energy density and 5 times the gravimetric energy density of lithium-ion batteries (LIB). Hence, Li-S batteries are expected to be applied to stationary power sources and EV vehicles [1]. However, Li-S batteries have the following issues:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\u30fbSulfur and the final discharge product (Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S) are insulators.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\u30fbIn the discharge process, sulfur expands up to 1.8 times, so the structure of batteries is unstable.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\u30fbIntermediate products (Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>x</jats:sub> (x = 4 \u2013 8)) dissolve in an electrolyte; Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>x</jats:sub> (x = 4 \u2013 8) diffused to an anode to provide an insulating layer at the anode surface.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\u30fbIn the charge process, Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>x</jats:sub> (x = 4 \u2013 8) causes redox shuttling.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>As a result, Li-S batteries cannot charge and discharge stably. In order to deal with this problem, Nazar et al. reported the method that sulfur is confined in porous carbon [2]. This approach provides a cathode realizing good electronic conductivity, restriction of sulfur expansion, and suppression of Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>x</jats:sub> (x = 4 \u2013 8) dissolution. Although these improved characteristics allow Li-S batteries to operate, The discharge capacity of Li-S batteries is still not high enough and this needs to be addressed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In our previous study, we reported that oxidation treatment to microporous carbon (MC) with HNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> improves Li-S batteries' discharge capacity [3]. Moreover, we clarified that the discharge capacity of Li-S batteries has an approximate proportional relation with the amount of oxygen-containing functional groups on the MC surface [4].</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This work attempts to elucidate the mechanism of improved Li-S battery performance by oxidation treatment to MC. Our report would lead to the proposal of a novel strategy to improve the performance of Li-S batteries.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>2. Method</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>2.1 Preparation of Oxidized MC-Sulfur composite (Ox MC-S)</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>MC was added into 69 wt.% HNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and refluxed at 120\u00baC for 2 h. By vacuum filtration and washing with deionized water, Ox MC was obtained. Ox MC dried in vacuum at 80\u00baC overnight was mixed with sulfur at a weight ratio of Ox MC: S = 48: 52. The mixture was thermally annealed at 155\u00baC for 5 h (Ox MC-S). Untreated MC was also composited with sulfur by the same method (MC-S).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>2.2 Assembling of Cells</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Each MC-S cathode was prepared by mixing the MC-S, acetylene black, carboxymethyl cellulose, and styrene butadiene rubber at a respective weight ratio of 89: 5: 3: 3 and coating the resulting aqueous slurry on an Al foil current collector. The cells with the MC-S electrode and Li metal foil as an anode were assembled in a glove box filled with Ar. Lithium bis(trifluorosulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI): tetraglyme (G4): hydrofluoroether (HFE) = 10: 8: 40 (by mol) was used as the electrolyte.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>2.3 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To elucidate the effect of oxidation treatment on the internal resistance of Li-S batteries, EIS was carried out at various potentials (Discharge 2.0 \u2013 1.0 V and Charge 1.0 \u2013 3.0 V). The obtained Nyquist plots were used for the evaluation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) resistance (Rsei), charge-transfer resistance (Rct), and Warburg impedance (Rw). Rw was investigated with the calculation of Warburg coefficient (\u03c3).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>3. Major results and conclusion</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Since oxidation treatment to MC significantly increased the discharge capacity of Li-S batteries [3][4], it was expected that oxidation treatment would lower the internal resistance of Li-S batteries. EIS of MC-S and Ox MC-S at various potentials showed that oxidation treatment reduced Rsei by an average of 12.2 \u03a9. This indicates that the SEI thickness was reduced, or the SEI was composed of highly ion-conductive components by the oxidation treatment. Rct decreased only at lower potentials, and the Warburg coefficient decreased except at the end of charge and discharge potential. These results suggest that the oxidation treatment decreases overall resistance, but especially SEI resistance and Warburg impedance, which may improve the discharge capacity of Li-S batteries.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We will also report the activation energy of Rsei and Rct and mechanism analysis of decreasing Rsei by oxidation to MC.

However, the electrode-electrolyte interface instability hinders its commercialization as rechargeable batteries. During cycles of charging and discharging, the lithium metal anode is electrochemically plated and stripped along with the morphological evolution, which determines the cycling performance. In this work, with a phase-field model, we computationally characterize the morphological evolution dynamics during the plating and stripping steps at the lithium-metal-electrolyte interface. Our model is valid in a wide range of lithium concentrations in liquid electrolytes by incorporating nonidealities of electrolyte solutions into the interfacial reaction kinetics. Intriguingly, at fast stripping, i.e. high discharging overpotential, we observe an unexpected localized recrystallization phenomenon in high-lithium-ion-concentration valley regions. This recrystallization phenomenon mitigates the overall reaction rate heterogeneity and provides a potential approach to improve morphological stability. Furthermore, we systematically investigate the correlation between the recrystallization phenomenon and lithium-ion activity and draw a simplified phase diagram for the overpotential-dependent recrystallization.</jats:p>"}

In this presentation, we will report a simple interphase engineering approach by using an ionic electrolyte additive, lithium difluorophosphate (LiDFP). Through theoretical calculation, we found that self-decomposition product PO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>F of LiDFP additive is adsorbed strongly and uniformly on the Ni-rich cathode, which is further decomposed to Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> and LiF through the catalytic effect of transition metals. The new interphasial chemistry contributed from LiDFP stabilizes the bulk structure of Ni-rich cathode materials and prevents the performance degradation by suppressing the dissolution of transition metals and undesired structural changes. Even after 200 cycles with charge limit as high as 4.8 V, no rock-salt phase can be detected in LiNi<jats:sub>0.76</jats:sub>Co<jats:sub>0.10</jats:sub>Mn<jats:sub>0.14</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (NMC76), and the cell consisting of NMC76 cathode and lithium metal anode retains 97% of the initial capacity (235 mAh/g). Various advanced characterizations were used, on both atomic and electrode levels, to reveal the mechanism how a new interphase stabilizes the layer structures in bulk electrode. The dissolution of nickel was identified to be most serious at high voltage, rather than the widely believed manganese dissolution. The transition metal dissolution can be effectively suppressed by LiDFP additive. Furthermore, the cathode surface protected by LiDFP-derived interphase is shown to regulate a more uniform lithium distribution within the bulk cathode particles and effectively mitigate the strain and crack formation. Machine-learning assisted nano-tomography discovered that such interphase-bulk interaction is most effective for those small-sized, spherically-shaped particles.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Acknowledgement:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The work done at Brookhaven National Laboratory was supported by the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Vehicle Technology Office of the U.S. DOE through the Advanced Battery Materials Research (BMR) Program, (Battery500 Consortium), and Applied Battery Research for Transportation (ABRT) program under contract No. DE-SC0012704.

This is particularly true for practical LMBs with high areal capacity (&gt;\u20093.5 mAh/cm<sup>2</sup>), which generally requires a high areal current density (&gt;\u20091 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>) for an acceptable, realistic charging rate.

The unique pseudo<bold>-</bold>crown ether-like, folded molecular geometry endows its novel post-\u201cself-cleaning\u201d mechanism: the LiFEA could dissolve most undesirable organic species in the initial deposited solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and gradually enrich the inorganic species. This self-cleaning behavior of LiFEA results in homogeneous and more inorganic-rich, ultrathin SEI layers (which also contributes to high-quality cathode electrolyte interphase) and, therefore, outstanding lithium metal battery performances. Advanced LiFEA-based carbonate electrolytes could achieve high-performance cyclability and fast charging/discharging performances for LMBs. Li||NCM811 half cells enabled 500 cycles with an 83.5% capacity retention for 5 C-cycling (i.e., 3 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>), and full cells allowed 100 cycles with 86.5% capacity retention for cycling under the high current density of 5.2 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> (i.e., 2 C).

Serious safety hazards caused by short circuit and fire demand accurate control of the nucleation location of lithium deposition. Here, an inverted anode structure enabled by simple flipping of carbon fabric after lithium electrodeposition is reported. In contrast to traditional strategies of using regular upright structure, the inverted anode structure can guide a directional deposition of lithium to the bottom of the anode. The low nucleation barrier originating from the bottom lithium metal can induce a superior bottom\u2010up deposition process. Lithium dendrite issues can thus be significantly alleviated, and approximately twice the cycle life extension of the lithium metal anode is achieved. More importantly, the solid electrolyte interphase immersed in the inverted anode structure is extremely stable, resulting from the well supporting skeleton of the surrounding carbon fabric fibers. The assembled lithium metal batteries show excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention per cycle of 99.98%, i.e., the battery capacity still retains 82.3% after 750 charge/discharge cycles. This simple inversion strategy is universal and can be extended to other porous current collectors, such as thin conductive fabric, and offers great opportunities for next\u2010generation lithium\u2010based batteries.</jats:p>"}

In the present work, nanostructured transition metal sulfide (MS) and lithium transition metal sulfide (LMS) are used as artificial SEI on lithium metal anode by modifying the lithium metal/electrolyte interfaces and homogenous lithium deposition.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The nanostructured transition metal sulfide and lithium transition metal sulfide were synthesized by a simple wet chemical route at relatively low temperatures (150-200 \u00b0C). The synthesized LMS were typically of high purity and were filtered, washed, ball-milled, and calcined prior to use in the battery. The microstructure, structure and chemical analysis of the synthesized metal sulfide was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Figure 1(a) shows the morphology of the ball-milled LMS as a layered structure with varying sizes of 10 \u00b5m to 100 nm. The EDS analysis of the ball-milled powder majorly showed an M/S ratio of 1:1 and 1:2.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The LSM was deposited on Li metal substrate by sputtering technique from a LSM target in Ar atmosphere. This film deposition was carried out at different sputtering time (10 sec -100 sec) and processing pressures. Homogeneous deposition of this LSM of few tens of nanometers thickness was successfully achieved. The electrochemical performance of the LSM artificial SEI was investigated in symmetric cells of two coated Li electrodes and compared to bare Li (Figure 1(b)). At different current densities of 0.5 and 1 mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, repeated Li plating and stripping revealed an enhanced cycling performance of metal sulfide coated Li compared to bare Li electrode. To better understand the interfacial stability, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were performed at different stages of cycling. The cycling performance of coated and bare Li anode was performed in a full cell containing NMC811 as cathode. After cycling, the microstructural changes in lithium metal anode were explored using SEM.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Figure 1:</jats:bold> (a) SEM image of the ball-milled layered lithium metal sulfide and (b) Time-voltage profiles of the symmetric cells with Li anode and coated Li anode at the current density of 0.5 mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>References</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] D.

Here, by combing the titration gas chromatography method and cryogenic focused ion beam, a quantitative relationship between the chemical corrosion rate and electrochemically deposited Li morphology in various liquid electrolyte systems is established. It has been identified that the corrosion rate is dominated by the porosity of the deposited Li. The larger the porosity of deposited Li has, the faster the corrosion rate will be.

An all solid-state battery is often assumed to be safer compared to a Li-ion battery with an organic liquid electrolyte. If the energy density of a cell is increased through the introduction of Li metal, the potential temperature rise of the cell also increases, leading to a reduction in cell safety. In particular, during self-heating Li metal has the potential to react with the cathode itself and/or oxygen released from the cathode upon heating, as well as the solid electrolyte. The rate and extent of exothermic reactions in a specific battery chemistry and configuration determine whether self-heating could be created in a cell, as well as its onset temperature and rate. To quantify the thermal behavior of the reactions that occur within a Li metal solid state cell upon heating, we use differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). For the DSC measurements, we assemble all cell layers inside hermetically sealed stainless sealed pans, which allows us to carry out the analysis in an inert environment. With this platform, multiple cell chemistries and configurations can be tested, and the calorimetry of the reactions taking place among all cell components can be quantified.

Since the Li nucleation process significantly influences the final growth of Li, different cycling behaviors of LMAs would be expected depending on lithiophilic material [9]. As for the methods to adopt the lithiophilic materials, the electrodeposition is very attractive, since it can easily control the surface morphology, which might affect the Li deposition morphology and the related behavior. In this regard, we chose the tin (Sn) as a lithiophilic material, which can be deposited on Cu CC by electroplating, and moreover have a fast Li ion diffusion coefficient [10].</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Specifically, in this work, we study the effect of surface morphology of lithiophilic Sn deposited on copper CC by testing Li deposition/stripping behavior for a LMAs. For different morphology, a direct current electrodeposition (DC) and pulsed electrodeposition (PED) were used.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Fig.1</jats:bold> is FE-SEM images of Cu@Sn with DC growth and PED growth. <jats:bold>Fig.1 (a)</jats:bold> shows Sn particles are growing without filling the pores. However, <jats:bold>Fig.1 (c)</jats:bold> shows Sn particles are growing with filling the pores. At <jats:bold>Fig.1 (b) and (d)</jats:bold>, the morphology difference is conspicuous between DC and PED growth. <jats:bold>Fig.1 (b)</jats:bold> presents island growth in which nuclei grow on existing nuclei because there is only T<jats:sub>on</jats:sub> without relaxation time. While, <jats:bold>Fig.1 (d)</jats:bold> shows that after rearrangement of deposited atom at T<jats:sub>off</jats:sub>, new nucleation sites are created by continuously applying pulses, thereby obtaining the coalescence growth. At <jats:bold>Fig.2</jats:bold>, Cu@Sn (PED) shows the longer cycle life than bare Cu and Cu@Sn (DC) because Cu@Sn (PED) has an uniformly distributed nano Sn morphology, which provides more sites for Li nucleation to prevent dendritic growth.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>References</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] PARAJULY, Keshav; TERNALD, Daniel; KUEHR, Ruediger.

Here, an in situ cross\u2010linked plastic crystal\u2010based electrolyte (CPCE) with an optimized composition design is proposed. Based on the interaction of succinonitrile (SN) and ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) with polar carbonyl groups, CPCE delivers well\u2010tuned energy levels and a concentrated coordination structure, leading to an improved electrochemical window and stable electrode\u2013electrolyte interface. In addition, the crystallization of SN molecules is also inhibited, ensuring suitable ion migration in bulky CPCE over a wide temperature range. Moreover, both the nonleakage of cross\u2010linked ETPTA and the nonflammability of the plastic crystal electrolyte (PCE) further reinforce the safety of CPCE. As a result, the well\u2010designed CPCE achieves high ion conductivity with a wide electrochemical window (\u22485.4\u00a0V vs Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>/Li) and a broad operating temperature range (\u221220 to 100 \u00b0C).

In this study, we synthesize cubic phase Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) using a secondary sintering method.

Furthermore, it is shown that the AlN coating can effectively reduce the interface impedance between Li and the solid electrolyte and improve the lithium-ion transport. The assembled symmetric Li cells can operate stably for more than 3600 h, unlike the symmetric cells without AlN coating, which short-circuited after only a few cycles. The hybrid solid-state battery with a modified layer, which is assembled using LiFePO4 (LFP), still has a capacity of 120 mAh g\u22121 after 200 cycles, with a capacity retention rate of 98%.

The impact of applied stack pressure on separator morphology and electrochemical response is of particular interest, as external pressure can improve cell performance below a critical threshold. We explored the relationships between plating propensity, stack pressure, and material properties. External pressure suppresses lithium plating due to interfacial stress and separator pore closure, leading to inhomogeneous plating rates across the anode surface. For moderate applied pressures, dendrite growth is completely suppressed and it is expected that plating will occur in the electrolyte-filled gaps between anode and separator.

In general, a good separator is required to be both physically and chemically stable, avoiding unwanted reactions with strong oxidizing or reducing electrolytes near the cathode and anode surfaces, while maintaining mechanical strength avoiding failures despite the cyclic mechanical stresses during battery operation.[1] Separator is also needed to be wettable by the electrolyte and sufficiently porous to provide low resistance to ion transport and enable fast charging. Currently, most commercial separators based on polyolefin such as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) are widely used in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, polyolefin separators suffer from low heat resistance due to their low melting points (usually &lt;160 \u2103), which may cause safety concerns. In addition, they are not wetted well by all electrolytes and are often not designed for ultra-fast charging.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Compared to PP or PE, polyetherimide (PEI) has a higher melting point (&gt; 300 \u2103). Porous PEI separator membranes can be fabricated via phase inversion method [2] to provide good ion conductivity and a higher heat resistance. Yet, the weak tensile/puncture strength could make it vulnerable towards mechanical damages during battery cycling. PEI also experiences severe shrinkage at high temperatures (&gt;240 \u00b0C). To address these issues, we developed a facile and scalable strategy to incorporate a thin layer of ceramic nanowires on both surfaces of the PEI membrane. Heat resistance tests suggest our separators can survive high temperature up to 400 \u00b0C, as the coating minimized the shrinkage of the PEI. The inner polymer layer could melt at elevated temperatures, thus forming a shut-down layer between the ceramic layer to further enhance cell safety. These results indicate our nanowire coated separators can allow batteries to operate safely even at extremely high temperatures.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] M.

Replacing the graphite-based anode with Li metal is the easiest way to increase energy density. However, a lithium metal anode is prone to non-uniform plating/striping that leads to capacity decay and dendrite formation. Dendrites trigger short-circuiting and possible explosions as the liquid electrolytes that are used in Li-ion batteries are flammable. Solid-state batteries (SSBs) have the potential to enable Li-metal anodes as they are typically less reactive and nonflammable. Additionally, SSBs exhibit greater mechanical stability and can prevent dendritic growth [1,2]. Furthermore, solid electrolytes show much higher thermal stability, are non-toxic, and have high energy density, making the solid-state battery one of the best choices for the next generation of energy storage devices.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Solid polymer electrolytes are an important class of materials for making solid-state batteries commercially viable. These have the potential to increase energy density and decrease contact resistance between anode and separator by formation of a suitable solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI) [1]. However, this technology still has major hurdles to overcome, like lower Li-ion conductivity when compared to state-of-art ceramic separators. In recent years, garnet-type lithium oxide perovskites have gained attractiveness as state-of-art ceramic separators for SSBs. LLZTO is one such ceramic electrolyte that is being thoroughly investigated by researchers as it shows very high Li-ion conductivity at room temperature [2]. However, these materials suffer from poor interfacial contact. Recently, Yang, <jats:italic>et al., </jats:italic>[3] combined the best of both worlds with a new type of solid polymer separator which has better physical contact between separator and lithium and good li-ion conductivity at room temperature.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this work, we investigate the transport of Li-ions across both a solid polymer electrolyte and LLZTO solid electrolyte using a symmetric Li-cell configuration. <jats:bold>Fig. 1 (a)</jats:bold> and <jats:bold>(c)</jats:bold> show the Li plating/stripping cycling performance in a symmetric cell. The cell voltage measured during plating and stripping is to be very high for LLZTO compared to polymer electrolyte. A possible explanation may be due to high interfacial resistance arising between solid ceramic and lithium metal. Impedance spectroscopy was performed on both LLZTO and polymer separators after each current density step (24 h) and shown in <jats:bold>Fig. 1 (b)</jats:bold> and <jats:bold>(d)</jats:bold> respectively. The impedance increased with cycling for the LLZTO separator but decreased with cycling for polymer electrolyte. This may indicate that better interfacial contact between Li and polymer exists and that these connections may become more established while cycling. Furthermore, the transport of Li-ions across the separators will be analyzed using the transference number calculated using the Bruce-Vincent method. The influence of temperature and separator thickness on the transference number will also be used to characterize the nature of ion transport across such solid electrolyte separators. Such deep understanding of the transport mechanism is needed to minimize the different losses in SSBs and make it commercially viable.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1: Li plating/stripping cycling performance of the (a) LLZTO electrolyte, and (c) PEO polymer electrolyte at different current density, with 12 minutes for each plating/stripping half cycle, for a total of 72 h at 70 \u2103 temperature and their corresponding impedance are shown in (b) and (d) respectively.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>References</jats:bold> \n                  <jats:list list-type=\"roman-lower\">\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>R.

In order to address the issues of interface performance and compatibility between solid electrolyte films prepared by magnetron sputtering and lithium metals and the suppression of lithium dendrite during the cycling, a three-layer interface solid electrolyte film based on carbon-doped lithium phosphate oxynitride (LiCPON) was employed for coating a lithium metal. The sandwich structure of LiCPON by introducing an ultra-thin lithium niobium oxynitride (LiNbON) layer prepared by sputtering LiNbO3 in nitrogen ambient can be confirmed by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. Atomic force microscopy data indicated that the surface of the LiCPON thin film with the sandwich structure is flatter and smoother than that of the LiCPON thin film on the lithium metal. The interface impedance of the symmetric battery based on the sandwich structure of the LiCPON coating lithium metal was reduced from 512.2 to 65.4 \u03a9, and the symmetric battery stable cycles from 300\u2009h with an overpotential of more than 200\u2009mV to 400\u2009h with low overpotential of about 77\u2009mV. These results suggest that functional multilayer solid electrolyte films become an effective method for protecting lithium. The incorporation of ultra-thin LiNbON into the LiCPON thin film could significantly decrease interface impedance between the lithium metal and solid electrolyte layer.</jats:p>"}

Such factors will be key for commercial deployment, in particular suitable for developing countries where microgrids for remote communities rely on intermittent renewable power supply. <jats:list list-type=\"roman-lower\">\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>Zhang, G., Zhang, Z.

Lithium plating and stripping during cell operation leads to the loss of active lithium and the formation of dendrites, which decrease battery capacity and lead to dangerous modes of failure such as fire. Application of external pressure has been shown to mitigate plating to an extent, as it alters the cell morphology and locations of high current density along the anode. In this work we present a 3-D, mesoscale model of lithium plating on an inhomogeneity characteristic of the rough lithium anode surface. The interplay between interfacial growth, state of stress, and ionic transport is explored in a coupled mechanics-electrochemical model. Local stress-induced changes in separator porosity and tortuosity limit bulk and surface ion transport, encouraging Li plating in regions of low stress and contact with liquid electrolyte. The initial electrochemical response across the Li anode surface is studied parametrically with respect to applied pressure, charge rate, and various material properties. The developed finite-element model is then used to simulate plating and stripping by moving the Li surface according to the local reaction rate; the evolution of the interface may thus be studied parametrically. Preliminary results show non-uniform plating across the protrusion that is highly dependent on applied pressure. As the interface evolves, changes in anode-separator contact redirect current and local stresses, leading to various modes of protrusion growth or flattening. This work will provide insight into the modes of protrusion growth based on material properties, applied pressure, and charging rate, and will inform cell design and manufacturing processes in order to mitigate plating and increase battery lifetime and safety.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Supported by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development program at Sandia National Laboratories, a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC., a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International, Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA-0003525.    </jats:p>"}

Integrating AI into battery research and development workflows has the potential to significantly increase the rate of new materials discovery, however, while machine learning models can successfully predict expected specific capacity or cycle life of the battery based on electrode designs, the complexity of liquid electrolytes used in batteries needs more contextual information than a machine or deep learning models can capture from simple structure-performance correlations.

For this purpose, we will discuss the scope of two AI approaches that can predict battery performance based on electrolyte composition. The first approach showcases the capability of a deep learning model that is designed specially to represent electrolyte formulation based on structure-to-performance relationship.

When comparing with today\u2019s state-of-the-art (SoA) electrode materials, one downside of the increased energy density of the next-generation materials is the drastically increased volume changes during formation and cycling. These next-generation materials exhibit volume changes theoretically up to ~300% for silicon, for example, and ~4.9 \u00b5m per mAh cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> for lithium metal [1].

In the following cycles, the irreversible thickness change decreases and a reversible thickness change between 8% - 10% is observed. Inhomogeneous pressure distribution as well as high applied pressures accelerate aging of the electrodes significantly. During CCCV charging, the anode potential drops below 0 V, causing lithium plating at an earlier state of charge for the inhomogeneous pressure distribution compared to the homogeneous pressure distribution due to localized exchange currents.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In contrary to the results of SoA-material, the cycling of lithium metal reveals high volumetric changes during stripping and plating of around 6 \u00b5m per mAh cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> (see Figure 1 (b)) [4].

By applying high pressure, the irreversible dilation can be suppressed especially at high current rates. Furthermore, the choice of the electrolyte has an impact on the irreversible dilation of the lithium metal and hence the performance during cycling.

To maximize the energy density of Li\u2212S batteries, it is crucial to increase the loading level of sulfur cathode and minimize the electrolyte content. However, excessive amounts of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) generated in the high loading Li-S batteries limit the stable cycling.

For example, physical barrier to polysulfides by improving the pore size of GPE or fabricating multidimensional structures by different preparation methods. Further chemical adsorption of polysulfides by adding nanofillers to increase polar sites to create polar\u2010polar interactions with polysulfides or to create Lewis acid\u2010base interactions. However, although chemical adsorption can indeed highly immobilize polysulfides, it still brings disadvantages such as loss of active material. Therefore, other researchers have employed GPE with ion\u2010selective permeability that has electrostatic repulsive force or steric hindrance to polysulfides to better inhibit polysulfide shuttling. However, modifying only the cathode side is not enough to enhance this overall properties of Li\u2212S cells. These problems of poor Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> transport, lithium dendrite growth, and poor SEI due to uneven lithium ion deposit on Li anode side still affect the overall performance of Li\u2212S cells. Therefore, a GPE to improve these problems on the Li anode side is summarized below. Compared with an all\u2010solid electrolyte, GPE, which has a partially liquid electrolyte, clearly has advantages such as strong interfacial contact, good anode interface compatibility, and high flexibility. However, it is still not comparable to the ionic conductivity, etc. of pure liquid electrolyte only. Therefore, the problems on the lithium metal anode side are mainly focused on the lithium ion transport problems and the problems of lithium dendrite growth and inhomogeneous SEI at the lithium anode interface. Facing the problems in these two aspects, researchers have given many improvement solutions respectively. For the lithium ion transport problem, researchers have instead provided pathways for lithium ion transport by adding amorphous nanofibers or nanofillers to reduce the crystallinity of the polymer and improve the ionic conductivity. Alternatively, the migration number of lithium ions can be increased by limiting the anions in the electrolyte. As for the interfacial problems of lithium anodes, researchers have effectively suppressed the growth of lithium dendrites or inhomogeneous lithium plating/stripping phenomena mainly by adding nanofillers to increase the mechanical strength of GPE or by participating in the generation of SEI.</jats:p>"}

Analogous improvement in energy is possible with sodium metal batteries (NMBs) and with potassium metal batteries (KMBs), where existing ion insertion anodes can be replaced by plating/stripping metal. However, in all three cases safety and performance are compromised by an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that consumes metal ions and electrolyte, and ultimately leads to dendrites. This presentation provides a series of case studies derived from the group's LMB, NMB and KMB research on the microstructural design principles that provide for long-term cycling and fast-charge stability of metal anodes. The approaches may be categorized as the following: a) design of plating/stripping supports and templates with tuned geometry and functionality; b) design of secondary interlayers placed between the metal anode and the separator; and c) design of multifunctional hybrid separators to replace the conventional polymer separators employed with LIBs. It is demonstrated that despite appearing distinct, the efficacy of each in enabling electrochemical stability originates from three fundamental features that are directly interrelated. The wetting behavior of the electrolyte on the anode must be optimized, the wetting/stripping behavior of the metal anode on the current collector must be controlled, and a geometrically and chemically modified SEI must be established.

However, the practical application of the Li anode is severely hindered by its high reactivity with standard electrolyte compositions, which results in limited Coulombic efficiency (CE) in those electrolytes (for instance, 85-90% with 1 M LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> EC:DEC [2]). Strategies to improve CE have focused on electrolyte engineering, including development of highly concentrated electrolytes (HCE) and more recently, local high-concentration electrolytes (LHCE) [3]. A feature shared by these strategies is the promotion of contact-ion pairing, which enhances anion contributions to the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Among the best-performing salts are fluorinated lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI), which are believed to promote stable inorganic-rich SEIs and correlate with higher CE [4]. A second strategy of interest is to pursue development of additives incorporated at relatively low concentrations (<jats:italic>e.g.</jats:italic>, 2-5 wt%) that can favorably alter the SEI, such as carbonates (<jats:italic>e.g.</jats:italic>, vinylene carbonate (VC) [5] and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) [6]), sulfates (<jats:italic>e.g.</jats:italic>, ethylene sulfate (DTD) and 1,3-propanesulfonate (PS) [7]), and borates (<jats:italic>e.g.</jats:italic>, lithium difluoro(oxoalate) borate (LiDFOB) [8] and tris (2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) borate (TTFEB) [9]). An advantage of this strategy is the possibility to ultimately lower reliance on high fluorinated salt concentrations, which are costly and can be corrosive towards the Al current collector, and potentially expand the versatility of available electrolyte frameworks having competitive CE. However, compared to the principles developed for salt and solvent selection in HCE and LHCE, the mechanism behind successful additive activation needs elucidation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this work, we examined the potential of \"FSI-like,\" neutral sulfonyl/sulfamoyl fluorides (R-SO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>F and R-R\u2019-NSO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>F, Figure 1) as functional additives for Li cycling, motivated by their structural similarity to the high-performance FSI<jats:sup>-</jats:sup> anion. The examined baseline electrolytes include high-CE systems consisting of LiFSI dissolved in various solvents: fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC, 1 and 4 M salt), 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME, 4 M), and dimethyl carbonate (DMC, 6 M). The ability for each additive to coordinate with Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> was first examined by NMR, with trends rationalized in part by supporting microcalorimetry data on the degree of solvent coordination strength. We relate these to CE and cycling outcomes in each electrolyte. Interestingly, we find that additives have negligible effect on CE in FEC-based electrolytes, whereas significant impacts were observed in DME and DMC. We relate these diverse outcomes to the SEI chemical compositions and gases evolved during galvanostatic cycling, as characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and gas chromatography (GC), which help to rationalize competitive reactions among solvent, anion, and additive. Unfortunately, additives had a negative-to-neutral impact on CE in these systems. Thus, we finally examined a LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> in carbonate electrolyte, 1 M LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> in EC/DMC (LP40), where we hypothesized that competitive reduction of coordinating additives over problematic carbonate solvent would lead to performance gains. Indeed, significant improvements (up to 94%, compared to baseline 89% over the initial 50 cycles) in CE were observed for two additives, with their structural advantages further discussed. Overall, our findings provide insights into the effects of sulfonyl/sulfamoyl fluoride additive structures on Li metal cyclability and the compositions of baseline electrolytes whose electrochemical cycling stability can be effectively modulated by these additives.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> \n                  <jats:list list-type=\"roman-lower\">\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>Xu, W., et al., <jats:italic>Lithium metal anodes for rechargeable batteries.</jats:italic> Energy &amp; Environmental Science, 2014.<jats:bold>7</jats:bold>(2):p.513-537.</jats:p>\n                     </jats:list-item>\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>Genovese, M., et al., <jats:italic>Combinatorial methods for improving lithium metal cycling efficiency.</jats:italic> Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 2018.<jats:bold>165</jats:bold>(13):p.A3000.</jats:p>\n                     </jats:list-item>\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>Hobold, G.M., et al., <jats:italic>Moving beyond 99.9% Coulombic efficiency for lithium anodes in liquid electrolytes.</jats:italic> Nature Energy, 2021.<jats:bold>6</jats:bold>(10):p.951-960.</jats:p>\n                     </jats:list-item>\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>Suo, L., et al., <jats:italic>Fluorine-donating electrolytes enable highly reversible 5-V-class Li metal batteries.</jats:italic> Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2018.<jats:bold>115</jats:bold>(6):p.1156-1161.</jats:p>\n                     </jats:list-item>\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>Aurbach, D., et al., <jats:italic>On the use of vinylene carbonate (VC) as an additive to electrolyte solutions for Li-ion batteries.</jats:italic> Electrochimica acta, 2002.<jats:bold>47</jats:bold>(9):p.1423-1439.</jats:p>\n                     </jats:list-item>\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>Markevich, E., et al., <jats:italic>Fluoroethylene carbonate as an important component in electrolyte solutions for high-voltage lithium batteries: role of surface chemistry on the cathode.</jats:italic> Langmuir, 2014.<jats:bold>30</jats:bold>(25):p.7414-7424.</jats:p>\n                     </jats:list-item>\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>Han, B., et al., <jats:italic>Poor Stability of Li2CO3 in the Solid Electrolyte Interphase of a Lithium</jats:italic>\n                           <jats:italic>\u2010Metal Anode Revealed by Cryo</jats:italic>\n                           <jats:italic>\u2010Electron Microscopy.</jats:italic> Advanced Materials, 2021.<jats:bold>33</jats:bold>(22):p.2100404.</jats:p>\n                     </jats:list-item>\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>Liu, J., et al., <jats:italic>Lithium difluoro (oxalato) borate as a functional additive for lithium-ion batteries.</jats:italic> Electrochemistry communications, 2007.<jats:bold>9</jats:bold>(3):p.475-479.</jats:p>\n                     </jats:list-item>\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>Ma, Y., et al., <jats:italic>Enabling reliable lithium metal batteries by a bifunctional anionic electrolyte additive.</jats:italic> Energy Storage Materials, 2018.<jats:bold>11</jats:bold>:p.197-204.</jats:p>\n                     </jats:list-item>\n                  </jats:list>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Figure 1.</jats:bold> (a) Sulfonyl/sulfamoyl fluoride chemical structures and (b) R-S and S-F bond lengths calculated by density functional theory.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"117fig1.jpg\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>"}

In addition, attempts and studies to implement a high energy density by applying a lithium metal anode to a Li-ion battery (LIB) system are in progress. However, the conventional organic liquid electrolytes have safety problems, such as a short circuit due to lithium dendrite growth, and a risk of ignition and explosion due to electrolyte leakage. To address the issues, all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) using stable solid electrolytes have attracted much attention as new-generation batteries. Among solid electrolytes, composite solid polymer electrolyte (CSPE) has excellent merits over existing liquid electrolytes such as no electrolyte leakage, non-flammability, and a wide electrochemical potential window. In addition, various types of inorganic fillers may be introduced to improve electrochemical properties of CSPEs.

The dynamic evolution of the dendrite morphology can be described in two stages. In the first stage, the energy reduction of the surface atoms induces localized reorientation of the originally single\u2010crystal dendrite and the formation of multiple domains. In the second stage, the energy reduction of internal atoms drives the migration of grain boundaries and the slipping of crystal domains. The results indicate that the formation of multiple domains might help to stabilize the dendrite, as a higher temperature trajectory in a single crystal dendrite without domains shows a higher dendrite collapsing rate. Several possible modes of morphological evolutions are also investigated, including surface diffusion of adatoms and configuration twists from [100] exposed surfaces to [110] exposed surfaces. In summary, reducing the surface and grain boundary energy drives the morphology evolution.

Alkaline metal anodes possess high theoretical capacity due to ability of metal-ions to pack in the dense crystal structure, however, their application is rather limited due to formation of dendrites from non-uniform metal deposition and/or poor quality of the interphase. Experimentally, it was found that variation of ionic liquid (IL) electrolyte composition (salt concentration, presence of cosolvent) and applied current density for the formation cycling, i.e., cycling to activate electrode surface before utilisation, significantly affect dendritic growth and stability of metal anode. This presentation aims to show the molecular level relationships between interfacial structure, value of metal deposition potential and the interphase formation with ionic liquid electrolyte of different compositions (salt concentration, presence of cosolvent). Each electrolyte composition results in a particular interfacial metal-ion solvation environment which controls the reductive stability, metal-ion deposition potential, and ultimately the composition and properties the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). The latter is dependent on the EDL composition such as the IL cation/metal cation-IL anion ratio or the presence of other surface active additives. Based on this work, our group at Deakin University developed a theoretical framework to choose an optimum current density for the formation cycling of lithium/sodium metal anodes with ionic liquid electrolytes of different composition (salt concentration, presence of cosolvent).

However, the traditional polyanion\u2010type structure of SSPEs inevitably gives rise to insufficient conductivity and inferior mechanical stability, which limits their practical application. Herein, an interpenetrating single\u2010ion network polymer (PTF\u20104EO) is fabricated by crosslinking lithium tetrakis(4\u2010(chloromethyl)\u20102,3,5,6\u2010tetrafluorophenyl)borate salt with tetraethylene glycol. The unique structure enables a PTF\u20104EO with weakly interacting anions and coordinating ether oxygen segments that functions as a high\u2010performing SSPE, that delivers a high room\u2010temperature conductivity of 3.53 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22124</jats:sup> S cm<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>, exceptional superior lithium\u2010ion transference number of 0.92, wide electrochemical window &gt;\u00a04.8\u00a0V, and good mechanical properties. Moreover, the resultant SSPE can directly participate in constructing a favorable Janus solid electrolyte interphase, which further enhances the interfacial stability of the metallic lithium anode.

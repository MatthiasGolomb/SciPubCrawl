Recently, liquid metal battery as a large-scale stationary energy storage system has attracted much attention due to the inherent advantages of long lifetime, low cost, and facile battery fabrication. Liquid metal battery is composed of three liquid layers that are self-segregated on the basis of their density differences and mutual immiscibility. Most of researches into liquid metal battery are now focused on lithium anode based battery cell due to a low melting point (181\u00b0C) of lithium, its low solubility into molten salts, and extremely high ionic conductivities and relatively low melting points (350-430\u00b0C) of lithium halides electrolyte. The low melting point of lithium based materials is attributable to reduce the cell operating temperature below 550\u00b0C. X. Ning et al. have reported lithium-bismuth (Li\u2016Bi) liquid metal battery operating at a temperature of 550\u00b0C which exhibits a median discharge voltage of 0.67 V. To facilitate the use of lithium anode based liquid metal battery, it is necessary to increase a median battery operating voltage which is determined by anode-cathode material combinations. This study investigated the effects of tellurium (Te) as cathode materials on the electrochemical properties (energy efficiency and cyclability) of lithium-bismuth liquid metal battery.

While these latent merits have been significantly plagued by the catastrophic safety issues of lithium metal anodes, which are tied to chronic problems such as (1) lithium dendritic growth and (2) the high reactivity of metallic lithium in electrolyte, recent intense demands for rechargeable batteries with higher energy density has made lithium metal come into the spotlight again. Moreover, various next-generation batteries including lithium-sulfur (Li-S) and lithium-oxygen (Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) systems with exceptionally high energy density heavily rely on the stable cycling of lithium metal electrode. Thus, the utilization of lithium metal anode in rechargeable system is pivotal not only for the further development of lithium \u2018ion\u2019 batteries employing high energy lithium metal anode, but also for the realization of the next-generation battery chemistries. Herein, we propose a facile and cost-effective approach to stabilize lithium metal anode using gas phase doping to the electrolyte. We find that the use of gaseous sulfur dioxide as an electrolyte additive is particularly effective for enhancing the chemical/electrochemical stability of the lithium metal surface among various gas additives. The surface analyses reveal that the reduction of sulfur dioxide gas occurs on the lithium metal and produces a thin layer of inorganic Li-S-O compounds, which aids in the development of artificially uniform SEI layers. It also leads to the homogeneous supply of lithium ions to the lithium electrode throughout the uniform SEI layer. Furthermore, the applicability of sulfur dioxide-induced protection layer is examined in several electrolyte systems including acetonitrile based electrolytes which are highly reactive with lithium metal, confirming the simple and effective gas doping strategy to stabilize lithium metal electrode for various types of lithium batteries. This finding of the enhancement of lithium metal stability using sulfur dioxide gas also suggests the underlying reason for the remarkably long calendar life and high efficiency of lithium-sulfur dioxide primary batteries that have been developed in 1970s. This revisit demonstrates that stable and homogeneous protection layers on the lithium metal induced by sulfur dioxide additives efficiently suppress the selective growth of lithium and provides with a detailed mechanistic study using the combined experimental and computational investigations.  </jats:p>"}

Lithium ion batteries (LIB), which is representative rechargeable energy storage system, is increasingly demanding to high-energy-density storage system for the stable operation of high performance devices like mobile, laptop, etc. In addition, a recent quantum leap in electronic vehicles (EVs) require to energy storage system with long cycling stability incomparable to previous electronic devices. To achieve high performances and long lifetime, the use of lithium metal is one of attractive anode for as LIBs, because Li metal has high theoretical specific capacity of 3860 mAh/g, low redox potential of -3.04V (verse the standard hydrogen electrode) and low gravimetric density of 0.59 g/cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. Nevertheless, since Li metal anode has the lithiation-delithiation mechanism of the \u2018hostless\u2019 electrochemical plating/stripping unlike the conventional graphite anode, it is confronted with serious problems occurred from uncontrollable interfacial reaction between surface of lithium metal anode and electrolyte applying to traditional LIB system; that is (1) the uncontrollable formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer limitless volume expansion of Li metal anode (2) the dendritic growth and isolation of Li interface derived from inhomogeneous deposition of Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ion flux (3) the Li surface fracture induced by heterogeneously plated Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ion. Through these process, repetitive formation of undesirable SEI layer at surface of Li anode make fresh electrolyte dissipation and concurrently the anode surface becomes more distorted. These side-phenomena strongly correlate with low coulombic efficiency and decreasing lifetime of lithium metal battery (LMB) system where lithium metal is used as anode. In this works, in a dimensional aspect, to solve such problem mentioned above through stabilizing of surface of lithium metal anode, we introduce Janus-faced protective layer (JPL) as gel polymer electrolyte. JPL was composed with dual layer of Ni (3~7\u03bcm) embedded poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) and bare PVdF-HFP through simple casting method. The process of preparing JPL membrane is so simple to instantly bring in existing roll-to-roll process, and it is also possible to make a low cost process considered relatively low nickel price. In terms of mechanical property, it is based on flexible polymer and shows the merit of being foldable enough to able origami. In addition, JPL play a role of protection of Li metal anode. JPL has two functionalities. The metal part of JPL directly contacted with anode, and this layer was frameworks for preventing irregular SEI layer formation through inward plating of Li ion, the polymer part is stable state enough to be used as a gel polymer electrolyte. When lithium metal anode is subjected to cycle-test while keeping in contact with the nickel side of JPL membrane, Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image showed that the surface of lithium metal anode was very clean without any fluctuation compared to the case where only polypropylene (PP) separator was used. (Figure. 1) Moreover, as shown in Figure 2., the LMB system applied JPL show high stability of tolerable overvoltage within 5mV, 15mV even at high-current of 10mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, 20mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, respectively, in Li//JPL/JPL//Li symmetric cell. These results are attributable to effective function of each layer as mentioned earlier. JPL consists of two layer, the tough and adhesive nature of PVdF-HFP prevents the polymer part from being damaged or torn by dendritic growth and simultaneously ensure that metal part functions as robust framework for SEI layer formation without escaped particle from the membrane. This frameworks induce the SEI layer, which can act as a resistive element, to grown in the metal part while surface of Li metal anode become get out of main subject from the SEI layer formation. By virtue of that property, JPL has not allow forming resistive elements on the surface of Li metal anode, preventing the voltage rising up due to the formation of resistive elements at surface, so tolerability of overvoltage with clean surface of anode is maintained. In conclusion, the model study of nickel micro-particle/PVdF-HFP composite suggests the straightforward direction of protective layer to apply lithium metal as anode in LIB system with alleviating the problem caused by the \u2018hostless\u2019 property of lithium metal anode. Thus, when JPL is introduced to a LIB system, it shows a fairly positive possibility for high performance Lithium metal battery.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>  </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"78fig1.jpeg\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>"}

One of the biggest obstacle against the wide spread in the market is dendrite formation at the anode during charging.[1] Many researches have been carried out where the mechanism of the dendrite formation of lithium metal were investigated in order to suppress the dendrite formation. Particularly the nano-scale and/or initial behavior of dendrite formation is of importance to elucidate the mechanism. Recently, peakforce-tapping mode AFM (atomic force microscopy) has been commercialized, where the damage to the sample surface from the AFM tip is much smaller than the damage in other conventional mode of AFM.[2] In this study, peakforce-tapping mode AFM was utilized to investigate the initial behavior of lithium electrodeposition in nano-scale in operand. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Lithium wire was cut in the electrolyte and was used as working electrode. Lithium wire was used as a counter electrode, and 0.1 M LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>/PC was used as electrolyte solution. Lithium was electrodeposited on working electrode with current density of 2.5 mA cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup>. The working electrode surface was observed by using peakforce-tapping mode AFM in operand. The height and adhesion mapping images were simultaneously obtained. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Two types of protrusions were observed in the series of height mapping images. One type of protrusions increased in size during electrodeposition, while the other type of protrusions kept their size. A series of adhesion mapping images indicate that the former type of protrusions had less adhesive surface than the latter type of protrusions. Furthermore, once the electrodeposition was stopped, the adhesion force of former type of protrusions increases and became the similar adhesion force of latter type of protrusions.[3] In PC solutions, the lithium surface is considered to be coated by surface film. The results may indicate that the surface film on the growing deposits is different from that of static-state deposits. In the case where dendrites had been suppressed, the deposits had been widely and uniformly spread and there had been no contrast at the adhesion images. The AFM technique can be used to detect the dendrite formation even at the very initial state of electrodeposition. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>References:</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] D.

Especially in order to popularize EVs, it is essential to improve the energy density in order to secure mileage. However, using commercialized graphite as an anode material is difficult to increase energy density due to their limited capacity. Li metal is an ideal anode material due to its extremely high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>), low density (0.59 g cm<jats:sup>-3</jats:sup>) and the lowest negative electrochemical potential (\u20123.040 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode). For instance, Li/air and Li/S batteries enable to increase dramatically energy density. However, Li metal has been proposed as a problem of deterioration of cell performance due to dendrite caused by charging / discharging process and battery short circuit.

The high abundance, low cost, high theoretical capacity (1675 mA h g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) and high energy density (2600 Wh kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) of sulfur made it a comprising candidate for LiS battery. Although LiS battery is having very high energy density, but not yet commercialized due to its poor cycle life, and low coulombic efficiency. The major challenges of LiS are the dissolution of higher order polysulfides intermediates in the organic electrolyte. These higher order polysulfides migrate to the lithium metal anode and get reduced which leads to overcharging, accumulation of insulating sulfur on the anode and capacity fading. This mechanism is known as shuttle mechanism. On the other hand, the dissolution of polysulfides is also important, which provides the fresh sulfur available for the further reaction to takes place. Using a polysulfide trapping interlayer between cathode and separator can minimize the shuttle effect. This interlayer should highly either attractive or repulsive to polysulfides such that they cannot penetrate through it and migrate to anode. Sulfur (S) to polysulfides (Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S) reduction happens in presence of the carbon, with high conductivity and high surface area. In the present work, a highly hydrophobic interlayer with high nitrogen content is designed, which can trap the intermediate polysulfides before they reach the anode. The use of partially exfoliated carbon nanotubes (PCNTs) as sulfur host can increase the reaction kinetics of the polysulfides with its high conductivity and surface area. The structural and morphological studies of the synthesized PCNTs sulfur composite (PCNTs/S) and nitrogen rich highly hydrophobic interlayer were done by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The use of PCNTs/S cathode with nitrogen rich highly hydrophobic interlayer for LiS battery has shown excellent cyclic stability for more than 100 cycles at 1C (1C = 1675 mA g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>), high rate capability up to 2C and specific capacity more than 1000 mA h g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> at 0.1C.  </jats:p>"}

Unlike with the currently-used graphite anode, the highly reactive surface of a lithium anode varies widely from cycle to cycle, which irreversibly consumes the finite amount of electrolyte and causes lithium metal to suffer from low Coulombic efficiency. To account for Coulombic inefficiency caused by electrolyte depletion, many researchers \"flood\" their cells with electrolyte to prolong cycle life.

Due to its high theoretical gravimetric capacity (3590 mAh g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> Li<jats:sub>15</jats:sub>Si<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>) and its low working potential, silicon is an attractive candidate to at least partially substitute the graphite anode [1]. Lithium-sulfur batteries are a promising battery system because of the high capacitive sulfur cathode (1672 mAh g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) and low material costs. But current cells mainly suffer from the instable lithium anode. Lithiated silicon could be a more stable alternative preventing dendrite formation and electrolyte decomposition for that next generation battery cell type [2]. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>During the lithiation process of silicon a large undesirable volume expansion occurs. This volume change leads to pulverisation of the silicon and a steady reformation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI). The electrolyte is consumed and the capacity declines rapidly. This is why silicon anodes with high quantities of silicon are hindered so far. To overcome these obstacles nanostructured silicon carbon composite anodes are very promising. The volume change is potentially compensated by the free volume between silicon core and carbon shell and a stable SEI is ensured at the surface of the carbon shell preventing electrolyte consumption during cycling. These void structures are mainly generated using silica templates which deliver a precise control of the void structure, but need to be removed by toxic hydrofluoric acid and laborious washing steps. In this work an easily scalable process without etching treatment is presented. The void structure results from the removal of a sacrificial template layer on the surface of commercially available silicon particles during the carbonization of the silicon carbon composite within a concerted process. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>For general electrochemical characterization the silicon carbon composite electrodes are galvanostatic cycled vs. metallic lithium in half cells with different electrolyte systems on coin cell as well as on pouch cell level.

The feasibility of both SLS cell concepts was successfully demonstrated in coin and in pouch cells. A new electrolyte composition is introduced to enhance the cycle life by stabilization of the SEI and prevention of the electrolyte depletion [4]. Finally, prospects, limits and suggestion for further research directions for SLS cells are envisioned, based on the estimation of the expectable energy density. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] J.

However they are constrained by low voltage, safety issues due to the lithium anode, charge retention, and cycle life to name a few issues. A variety of these drawbacks are frequently attributed to the so-called \u201cpolysulfide shuttle\u201d where partial discharge products from the cathode (polysulfide species such as Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>, Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, etc.) dissolve in the electrolyte and migrate to the anode where they wreak havoc.<jats:sup>1\u20134</jats:sup> Many approaches have been developed to mitigate this issue, however few attempts have been made to measure the amount of polysulfide in the electrolyte, particularly during cycling in a representative cell.

Several interesting trends were observed using this method, including that Li/S-MoS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> cathodes, ceramic coated separators and concentrated electrolytes all display lower concentration of polysulfide compared to the baseline Li/S cells. The quantity of polysulfide species changes during discharge, increasing dramatically during the second discharge plateau.

Low energy efficiency and poor cyclability due to large charging overpotential should be addressed for realizing practical LABs. Recently, it was reported that the overpotential especially during charging is greatly reduced and thus the cyclability is significantly improved by modification of air electrodes with a noble metal catalyst such as Pt or Ru<jats:sup> 1)</jats:sup>. An appropriate base metal-based electrode catalyst, e.g. Co<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> and MnO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>\n                  <jats:sup> 2)</jats:sup>, is also capable to effectively reduce the overpotential. In this study, the base metal-based ternary (Fe-Co-Ni) and binary (Fe- Ni, Fe-Co, and Co-Ni) alloy catalysts were prepared. Their catalytic activities on the discharge-charge reactions were evaluated and compared with the RuO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> catalyst. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Experimental </jats:bold>The base metal alloy-modified carbon, Fe-Co-Ni/KB, Fe-Ni/KB, Fe-Co/KB, and Co-Ni/KB (KB: Ketjen black), were prepared via the impregnation process. RuO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/KB was also prepared by a similar method. The catalyst-modified carbon and polyvinylidene fluoride were mixed together with <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solution. The obtained slurry was coated on the carbon paper and dried in vacuum at 80 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C overnight. The coin-type cell of CR2032 consisting of the carbon cathode, lithium metal anode, and 1 mol dm<jats:sup>-3</jats:sup> LiTFSA/tetraglyme electrolyte was assembled in an Ar filled glovebox. For the electrochemical measurement, the discharge-charge tests were carried out in dry air atmosphere at 25 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C in the voltage range of 2.0 - 4.3 V at the current density of 50 \u03bcA cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup>. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Results and Discussion</jats:bold> Figure 1 shows the 1st and 20th discharge-charge curves of the coin cells with the prepared catalyst-modified carbon electrodes. The discharge behavior was similar, ca. 2.7 V of stable plateau observed, regardless of the carbon electrodes used. On the other hand, a remarkable difference was observed in the charging process, depending on the type of the catalysts. The RuO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> catalyst effectively suppresses the charging overpotential over 20 cycles. The overpotential of the Fe-Ni/KB electrode was also small during the initial charging stage at the 1st cycle, while the catalytic activity of this catalyst would be almost completely diminished after 20 cycles. On the other hand, the charging overpotential of the other electrodes with Co was very large irrespective of the cycle number. As the ternary Fe-Co-Ni catalyst is found to be not contributed to decreasing charging overpotential, the catalytic activity of Co would be considerably small and/or Co would impede the catalytic activity of other metals. Unfortunately, the air electrodes are rather spoiled by the presence of the base-metal based catalysts, probably due to oxidation of the catalysts during charging process. Improvement in catalyst durability is pivotal to achieve the cost-effective base metal-based electrode catalysts for LABs. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Reference</jats:bold>\n                  <jats:bold>s</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>1) F.

Vanadium redox flow battery is one of the typical large-scaled energy storage devices using aqueous solutions for both anolye and catholyte.[1] The cell voltages of such aqueous redox flow batteries are often limited by the electrochemical potential window of water. In order to enlarge the cell voltage and increase energy density, it is necessary to use aprotic electrolytes having wider electrochemical potential windows. Typical aprotic electrolytes used for non-aqueous batteries like lithium-ion batteries are composed of organic solvents, which are volatile and flammable. However, such organic electrolytes are unfavorable especially for the large-scaled batteries requiring large amount of electrolytes because of safety in case of accident. Therefore, it is necessary to select less flammable electrolytes for non-aqueous redox flow batteries. The equimolar mixture of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonly)amide (LiTFSA) and tetraglyme (G4) has been known to form the solvate ionic liquid, which is composed of a lithium-G4 complex, [Li(G4)]<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, and TFSA<jats:sup>\u2013</jats:sup>, and exhibits such properties as less volatility, less flammability, and wide electrochemical potential window, similar to those of ionic liquids.[2,3] The high concentration of lithium species in the solvate ionic liquid is also advantageous to the batteries using lithium ion as a charge carrier. Since the cathodic limit of the solvate ionic liquid is determined by deposition and dissolution of lithium, it is possible to construct the batteries combining a lithium anode with the redox reactions dissolved in the solvate ionic liquid using a lithium-ion conductive solid-state electrolyte as a separator between the anolyte and catholyte. We have already proposed the battery using the redox reaction of tris(2,2'-bipyridine)iron(III/II) complexes in the solvate ionic liquid with the cell voltage of about 4 V.[4] In the present study, the redox reaction of a stable free radical, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO), was investigated in the solvate ionic liquid, [Li(G4)]TFSA, for application to the redox flow battery. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Both TEMPO and its oxidized form, TEMPO<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, were found to be soluble in the solvate ionic liquid at ambient temperature. The redox reaction of TEMPO<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>/TEMPO was observed in the cyclic voltammetry of a glassy carbon electrode in [Li(G4)]TFSA containing TEMPO. The diffusion of TEMPO was found to be faster than that of TEMPO<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, probably due to coulombic interaction of TEMPO<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> with the ions composing the solvate ionic liquid. The standard rate constant was determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The temperature dependence of the standard rate constant suggested the redox reaction of TEMPO<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>/TEMPO can be regarded as an outer-sphere electron transfer reaction with a small reorganization energy. The redox battery was constructed using a lithium anode and the catholyte of the solvate ionic liquid containing TEMPO with a thin lithium-ion conductive solid-state electrolyte membrane. The redox battery could be operated successfully with the average discharge voltage of 3.4 V. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] A. Z. Weber, M. M.

Similarly, pursuit of high energy density rechargeable lithium metal battery (LMB) cathodes have led to sulfur (for a Li-S battery), air electrode (for a Li-air battery) or intercalation compounds (e.g. NbSe<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, V<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>5</jats:sub>) to realize high voltage LMBs exhibiting high energy densities.

Thin-film solid-polymer electrolyte batteries offer the potential for improved safety because of the reduced activity of lithium with the solid electrolyte, flexibility in design as the cell can be fabricated in various sizes and shapes, and high energy density. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this work, we demonstrate the use of a composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) with modified physical and chemical properties in Li-S batteries. These CPEs exhibits superior mechanical properties, excellent room-temperature lithium ion conductivity and low electrolyte: sulfur (E:S) ratio. These CPEs, when used as electrolytes for Li-S batteries, helps prevent both polysulfide dissolution and dendrite formation, in addition to providing very high energy density (~750 Wh/kg). Structural, chemical, physical and electrochemical characterization results validating these properties of the CPEs will be presented and discussed. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Acknowledgements: </jats:bold>The authors acknowledge the financial support of DOE grant DE-EE 0006825 and DE-EE-0008199, Edward R.

Indeed, the formation of metal dendrite upon repeated electrochemical plating/stripping cycling was early identified as obstacle of the development of safe metal anode secondary batteries. Also, due to dendrite formation, the low cycle efficiency and unstable cycle life happen, which hinder their practical application as anode materials. Therefore, to suppress the growth of metal dendrite is one of the most critical issues from a practical view point. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Recently, lithium metal has been extensively researched as anode candidate for secondary batteries due to its lowest redox potential and highest specific capacity among metallic anodes. Despite these promising properties, lithium sources are relatively limited and unevenly distributed across the globe, which lead to high costs of lithium metal batteries. Therefore, inevitably, lithium-based batteries will become unaffordable and large-scale production will falter. Therefore, sodium (Na) is one of the promising alternatives to lithium for energy storage technologies because of its relatively high theoretical specific capacity of 1166 mAh g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> and natural abundance. Also, it has comparable redox potential, that is -2.70 V vs. SHE. However, like lithium metal anode, inhomogeneous electrochemical deposition of Na is a crucial problem that have to be solved for the usage of sodium metal as anode safely. Furthermore, Na metal has extremely high reactivity with liquid organic electrolyte, so high interfacial resistance could be induced due to continuous electrolyte decomposition during battery cycling, which also leads to earlier cell failure. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this research, we present a stabilized sodium electrode by introducing electrically connected carbon network (ECN) to a bulk Na electrode with a simple folding &amp; rolling method.

Also, we found that the cycling stability of Na/Na symmetric cell with ECN was almost 4.5 times increased compared to bare Na/Na cell, which is consistent with the results of EIS during cycling. By using SEM and CA analysis, we confirmed that an introduced ECN could act as not only an electrical network but also artificial uniform seed for Na nucleation.  </jats:p>"}

While various techniques have been used to characterize lithium-ion batteries, there are limitations to characterizing lithium metal because of its intrinsic high chemical reactivity, low thermal stability, and low atomic number making it prone to contamination and melting, while exhibiting weak scattering characteristics for electrons and x-rays [1]. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Recently, cryogenic transition electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) techniques have proven to be powerful for observing the fundamental structure and SEI composition of nanoscale electrochemically deposited lithium metal [2-3].

Therefore, we explore the ability of cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) to mill bulk lithium metal structures while minimizing local heating damage and gallium ion reactions. Using cryo-FIB, we observe notably different features from those of room temperature FIB milled cross-sections of electrochemically deposited lithium metal and solid-state thin-film lithium metal batteries. With this technique we demonstrate the ability to investigate cross-sections of plated lithium metal to observe nucleation, morphology, and density.

Detailed understanding of solid-solid interface structure-function relations is critical for the improvement and wide deployment of such batteries. The interfaces between lithium phosphorous oxynitride (\"LiPON\") solid electrolyte material, and lithium metal anode and Li(x)CoO(2) cathode surfaces, have been reported to generate solid electrolyte interphase (\"SEI\")-like products and/or disordered regions. Using electronic structure calculations, we predict that \"defective\" P-O-P sequences in disordered LiPON regions react with Li metal in battery operational timescales, but in general LiPON is kinetically inert towards lithium at room temperature. In contrast, transfer of oxygen atoms from low-energy Li(x)CoO(2) (104) surfaces to LiPON is much faster under ambient conditions. The mechanisms of the primary reaction steps, experimental results to partially corroborate these predictions, and possible mitigation strategies to reduce degradations are discussed. LiPON interfaces are found to be useful case studies in terms of addressing challenges in modeling redox-active oxide interfaces; differentiating electrochemical from interfacial chemical reactions; and highlighting the importance of kinetics-controlled processes during battery assembly, which often involves moderate processing temperatures. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This work was supported by Nanostructures for Electrical Energy Storage (NEES), an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences under Award Number DESC0001160.

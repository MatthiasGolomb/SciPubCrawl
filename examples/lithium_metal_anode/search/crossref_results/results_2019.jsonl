The limitations for lithium metal to be the ideal anode are mainly the uncontrollable dendritic lithium growth and low coulombic efficiency. This work uses the lab-made fresh thin lithium foil with the thickness of 50 \u00b5m to eliminate the thickness influence on cycle life. The following research mainly focus on understanding the failure mechanism of lithium metal anode from aspect of salt and solvent in electrolyte. Two and three electrode symmetric lithium metal coin cells were made using different electrolyte (lithium hexafluorophosphate \u2013LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>, Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide \u2013LiTFSI and Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide \u2013 LiFSI in Ethylene Carbonate and Diethyl Carbonate with volume ratio 50:50) with different concentration to test long cycle stability. The cycle life data shows the decreasing cycle life with the increasing mole concentration of LiFSI and LiTFSI electrolyte, while the cycle life of the cells using LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> electrolyte increases when using higher concentration. We believe both solvent and salt decomposition reactions influence the composition of Solid Electrolyte Interphase \u2013 SEI on lithium metal when cycling. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) will be used to realize the decomposition product of solvent and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) will be used to figure out the salt decomposition product. The evidence of lithium dendrite pierce the separator has been found by using Focused Ion Beam (FIB) with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Also the thickness of dead lithium will growth with cycles to fulfill the available space in the cells. Both coin cells and Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance (EQCM) were made to calculate the columbic efficiency by using different electrolyte mentioned above. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to analysis the SEI and charge transfer resistance change during cycles to identify which part mostly contribute the overpotential.

To this end, scholars are investigating an alternative idea to boost the energy density, safety and minimize cost to satisfy the need of the society. One of the new ideas is the use of alternative design such as anode-free rechargeable lithium metal battery. In anode-free, the absence of Li<jats:sup>+ </jats:sup>host anode material reduces the cell weight and space required for the anode as a result; energy density of the cell will therefore be, significantly larger compared to the conventional Li-ion batteries. Nevertheless, realizing this anode-free battery in practical applications is still handicapped. The major reason for the failure of this system is depletion of the active Li and consumption of electrolyte solvents during repair of the solid electrolyte interphase. To mitigate this issue developing a functional electrolyte is therefore the key solution to bring it into practical application. Therefore, here we developed cost effective, highly fluorinated interphases forming new electrolyte solution of carbonate-ether mixed fluorinated electrolyte design with the standardized commercial salt LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> which is stable at wider potential (2.5-4.5 V). The designed electrolyte suppresses dendrite growth, form conductive and stable LiF dominated solid electrolyte interface (SEI) for anode-free lithium metal battery using Cu\u2016LiNi<jats:sub>0.3</jats:sub>Mn<jats:sub>0.3</jats:sub>Co<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>.<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>.

The enhanced cycle life and well retained in capacity using the as-prepared electrolyte is mainly because of the synergistic effect of the partially fluorinated carbonated and ether based functional groups in which on contributes to the higher voltage and the other contributes to the higher efficiency.

Challenges such as high reactivity and lithium dendrite formation have kept lithium metal anodes away from practical applications in portable electronics and electric/hybrid vehicles. It is known that the lithium dendrite formation on anode surfaces during the charging process starts by the inhomogeneous deposition of metallic lithium during the electrochemical reduction of lithium cations. However, the underlying mechanisms of Li dendrite formation are still poorly understood. Therefore, gaining fundamental understanding of the early stages of lithium electrodeposition is crucial in order to overcome this challenge. In this work, Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations were conducted to study the electron transfer between lithium metal slab Li (100) and the electrolyte.

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) of LiCoO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-Germanium full cells has revealed that, at low temperatures, the conductivity of the traditional carbonate-based electrolyte is severely diminished; increasing concerns over electrolyte freezing and cell degradation. Conversely, galvanostatic cycling reveals substantial capacity fade for high temperatures (&gt;40\u00b0C), indicative of electrolyte decomposition. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Enhancing the thermal stability of LiBs is critical in advancing the commercial viability of LiBs operating at elevated temperatures. The high temperature performance of LiBs is limited by the instability and the susceptibility of the electrolyte to degradation at high temperatures. The traditional LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> electrolyte becomes rapidly unstable at elevated temperatures (&gt;40\u00b0C )<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, decomposing into toxic by-products like POF<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and HF. Recently, mixtures of ionic liquids (ILs) such as FSI, TFSI and Poly(PPDA) have emerged as potential replacements for the traditional carbonated-based electrolyte<jats:sup>4</jats:sup>. Moreover, investigatory studies by Xu et al.<jats:sup>5</jats:sup> found that lithium bis(oxolato)borate (LiBOB) has appeared as a promising candidate to replace the traditional LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> electrolyte salt, owing to increased thermodynamic stability along with a wider electrochemical stability window<jats:sup>6</jats:sup>. The low-cost of graphite-based LiBs is of little consolation when considering their drastically diminished performance in harsh climates. Electrolytes that can sufficiently function at low temperatures and remain thermodynamically stable at high temperatures is a requisite in developing the optimal LiB configuration for adequate functionality over a wide temperature range. A dual effort of improving both the anode and the electrolyte's functionality, over a wide temperature range, will go a long way in advancing the field of LiBs. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> \n                  <jats:list list-type=\"simple\">\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>Cheng, X.

This necessitates a comprehensive study of the dynamics of lithium deposition in Li-S batteries. Most of the research in Li-S batteries has focused on half-cell studies, which include a thick metallic-lithium chip as the anode. With an infinite supply of lithium, this precludes understanding the impact of lithium degradation and loss on electrochemical performance. Hence, an investigation of Li-S cell performance in the absence of a large excess of lithium, i.e., under lithium-limited conditions, is acutely needed. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To this end, a novel full-cell configuration for Li-S batteries is presented here that comprises a lithium sulfide cathode paired with a bare copper or nickel foil as the hostless-anode substrate for lithium deposition. As the cell has only a limited and stoichiometric amount of lithium from the cathode without any free lithium metal on the anode, its electrochemical performance is limited by the efficiency of lithium plating and stripping. This allows for a more realistic assessment of Li-S cell performance. In addition, the role and dynamical behavior of the lithium anode can be effectively clarified by contrasting the electrochemical performance of the full cell to a comparable half cell. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Counter-intuitively, the Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S full cell shows only a modest decline in electrochemical performance in comparison to the Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S half cell. It demonstrates reasonable capacity retention with an average Coulombic efficiency of 96% over 100 cycles. In contrast, the capacity of a similar lithium-plating-based full cell employing LiFePO<jats:sub>4 </jats:sub>cathodes declines to near zero within 10 cycles. The Coulombic efficiency of plating and stripping a comparable amount of lithium on copper foil is vastly improved for Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S counter electrode as opposed to Li-metal counter electrode. The exceptional robustness of the Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S system points to an intrinsic stabilization of the lithium-deposition process in Li-S batteries. Detailed morphological and compositional characterization of the deposited lithium shows that the polysulfide intermediates formed help modulate the plating of lithium by forming deposits of Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S and Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, which facilitate the formation of a smooth planar morphology. A comparison of various electrolyte formulations in full-cell configuration reveals a sharp divergence in electrochemical performance, which is not observed in half-cell configuration. Emanating from the disparate lithium-deposition characteristics in different electrolytes, this helps provide insights into the critical solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) components on the lithium surface that enable dynamic stabilization of lithium plating and stripping in Li-S batteries. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This configuration portrays a promising approach to a realistic and effective implementation of the lithium-metal anode in Li-S batteries. It is significant that a considerable enhancement in gravimetric and volumetric energy density can be achieved from eliminating excess lithium, while still maintaining reasonable electrochemical performance. The lithium-limited nature of this configuration makes it an ideal template for generating novel insights into the dynamics of lithium degradation and SEI formation. This work opens up a new frontier in research in Li-S batteries, bringing them one step closer to reality. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Figure</jats:bold>: Schematic illustration of the deposited lithium on the copper foil from a Cu || Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S full cell and the electrochemical performance of the Li || Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S half cell compared with Cu || Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S full cell.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>  </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"126fig1.jpeg\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>"}

[1, 5] At elevated temperatures, the high reactivity of HSAL can lead to fatal consequences, especailly in presence of liquid electrolyte (e.g. fire, explosion). Thus, the controlled deposition of lithium metal is crucial in order to guarantee safe operation of lithium metal batteries. This can be achieved by either modifying the charging process or the lithium metal surface (mechanically/chemically). Beyond that, lithium metal batteries based on either ceramic or polymer-based electrolytes are investigated. Therein, the cells are cycled to different sates of charge (SOC) and/or states of health (SOH) before analyzing the thermal stability by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This way, it is possible to determine distinct differences in the onset temperature for exothermic reactions and the evolving heat as a measure for the intensity of the reactions that might lead to a thermal runaway in large-scale cells.

Many reports in the literature utilize Li-metal cells with significant excess lithium, thereby artificially inflating the cycling efficiency and cycle life of such cells since lost lithium inventory can be replaced from a vast reservoir. However, utilizing significant excess lithium can drastically reduce the energy density of Li-metal cells even below that of conventional Li-ion as shown in Figure 1; at 200% excess lithium, the theoretical volumetric capacity of Li of 2060 mAh/L becomes 687 mAh/L, lower than the volumetric capacity of graphite of 719 mAh/L. Clearly cells with significant excess lithium are not poised to succeed conventional lithium ion cells in delivering superior energy density. In contrast, anode-free cells do not utilize excess lithium and thus can deliver the maximum theoretical capacity of lithium metal.

However, the undesired dendrite growth results in detrimental effects in the cell performance, such as cell short-circuit, low coulombic efficiency, and dead lithium, which have hampered widespread exploits of lithium metal-based batteries. Therefore, in recent year, numerous strategies to prevent or mitigate the problematic dendrite growth, including protective layers on Li metal surface, solid electrolytes, artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and so forth has been reported. Among them, one of the effective methods is to provide heterogeneous lithiophilic nucleation sites on the surface of current collectors as first suggested by Yan et al., [2]. They found that heterogeneous metal seeds, which have solubility of lithium in binary phase diagram, could induce selective deposition of lithium on its surface. Recently, Hou et al., reported lithiophilic Ag nanoparticles as nucleation sites by using electroless deposition for stable electrodeposition of lithium [3]. However, from a heterogeneous nucleation point of view, the morphology of electrodeposited lithium metal will be strongly affected by uniformity of nucleation seed layers, in other words, the more uniform distribution of nucleation seeds, the more stable morphology of lithium. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this study, we introduce a thermal evaporation method to deposit Ag nanoparticles as well-distributed nucleation sites. The Ag seeds with various evaporation thicknesses (1, 3 and 5 nm) were deposited on the commercial copper foils (thickness \u2248 25 um) to study the effect of evaporation thickness on the morphology of electrodeposited lithium metal. To electrodeposit lithium on Ag-seeded Cu foil and investigate the electrochemical properties of deposited Li metal electrodes, CR 2032-type coin cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box (CE: Li strip, WE: Ag-seeded Cu foil, and Celgard separator). We used 1M lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide (LiTFSI) dissolved in 1,3-dioxolane/1,2-dimethoxyethane (DOL/DME, 1:1 by volume) as electrolyte without any additives. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold> Figure 1</jats:bold> shows SEM surface morphologies of a pristine copper foil and Ag-seeded Cu foils with different evaporation thicknesses of Ag. After evaporation of Ag 1 nm on the pristine Cu foil (<jats:bold>Fig. 1-(a)</jats:bold>), it is showed that nano-sized Ag particles uniformly distributed on the surface of Cu foil (<jats:bold>Fig. 1-(b)</jats:bold>). In addition, from <jats:bold>Fig. 1-(b)</jats:bold> to <jats:bold>Fig. 1-(d)</jats:bold> it is clearly confirmed that the sizes of Ag particles increased with increasing evaporation thicknesses. <jats:bold>Figure 2</jats:bold> shows the morphologies of electrodeposited lithium on Ag-seeded layers with different evaporation thickness. <jats:bold>Figure 2-(a)</jats:bold> shows SEM image of lithium metal deposited on a pristine Cu foil, which has well-known dendritic structure. In case of electrodeposited lithium on the Ag 1 nm-seeded Cu foil (<jats:bold>Fig. 2-(b)</jats:bold>), it also shows dendrites on its surface although heterogeneous nucleation sites are provided. However, the morphology of lithium on the Ag-3nm seeded Cu foil has distinct differences in shape and size of lithium deposits (<jats:bold>Fig. 2-(c)</jats:bold>). The width size of lithium deposits was smaller than those of Ag 1 nm-seeded Cu foil and pristine Cu foil, and they have interlacing vine-like structure. Further increased evaporation thickness of Ag nucleation layer to 5 nm leads to large morphological changes of electrodeposited lithium metal (<jats:bold>Fig. 2-(d)</jats:bold>). It shows highly dense structure with less pore and flat surface, meaning that dendrite-free lithium film was deposited. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In summary, we used thermally evaporated Ag nanoparticles as heterogeneous nucleation sites to electroplate uniform lithium metal. From the results, it was concluded that through a facile thermal evaporation controllable and well-distributed heterogeneous nucleation metal seeds can be formed on the commercial Cu current collectors, leading to a dendrite-free deposition of lithium. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>References</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] X.-B Cheng, R.

However, the breakthrough of the ASSB technology is facing practical challenges in terms of processing, rate capability and cycle life. [2] In addition to high energy densities and a long cycle life, significantly enhanced safety properties are considered key for future battery technologies. Regarding the latter, the ASSB benefits from the absence of flammable liquid electrolyte compared to LIBs.

Therein, it has to be considered that during charging lithium metal does not deposit homogeneously but forms dendritic or mossy structures often referred to as high surface area lithium (HSAL). [1, 4] At elevated temperatures, the high reactivity of HSAL in presence of liquid electrolyte can lead to fatal consequences (e.g. fire, explosion). Thus, the controlled deposition of lithium metal is crucial in order to guarantee safe operation of lithium metal batteries. This can be achieved by either modifying the charging process or the lithium metal surface (mechanically/chemically). Beyond that, lithium metal batteries based on either ceramic or polymer-based electrolytes are investigated. Therein, the cells are cycled to different sates of charge (SOC) and/or states of health (SOH) before analyzing the thermal stability by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This way, it is possible to determine distinct differences in the onset temperature for exothermic reactions and the evolving heat as a measure for the intensity of the reactions that might lead to a thermal runaway in large-scale cells. Moreover, the thermal stability of the cell components are characterized individually and in presence of each other. In combination with comprehensive <jats:italic>post-mortem</jats:italic> analysis, it is possible to determine the factors influencing the thermal stability most.

The most promising alternatives will be those that can achieve cell level energy density larger than that of state-of-the-art lithium ion batteries at a comparable or lower cost. Based on these criteria, anode free lithium metal cells emerge as potentially useful lithium-ion alternatives as their simple cell construction can enable both high energy density and low cost assembly. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In anode free cells, the negative electrode begins as a bare copper current collector and the lithium metal anode is plated in-situ from the lithium inventory in the cathode. These cells can achieve energy density 40-50% greater than lithium-ion at the cell level and have a simpler cell construction that eliminates the need to handle lithium metal foils or coat active materials on the negative current collector. However, the cycling stability of these cells in conventional carbonate liquid electrolytes is often terrible due to the low CE of lithium metal and the lack of an excess lithium reservoir. In this way, anode free cells exaggerate the technical challenges of lithium metal which makes them excellent test vehicles for optimizing lithium metal cycling. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this presentation we will highlight our progress in improving lithium metal cycling efficiency in liquid electrolytes toward the development of safe, practical, high energy density anode free cells. Much of this work focuses on the development and characterization of anode free LiNi<jats:sub>0.5</jats:sub>Mn<jats:sub>0.3</jats:sub>Co<jats:sub>0.2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2 </jats:sub>(NMC 532)//Cu wound pouch cells. We demonstrate that the cycling stability and safety of these cells is directly correlated to the morphology of the lithium plated during charge. High surface area mossy lithium deposits in conventional liquid electrolytes lead to fast capacity fade and high anode reactivity. We will also show how many different factors including, cycling rate, charge protocol, applied pressure, temperature, and electrolyte composition affect lithium morphology. Our latest results will be highlighted which show that with the appropriate electrolyte chemistry and cycling conditions, smooth lithium morphology with densely packed columns 50 um in diameter can be achieved after cycling in liquid electrolytes. This excellent lithium morphology significantly improves the capacity retention (Figure 1) of anode free cells and limits the reactivity of the deposited lithium. Cell failure mechanisms will also be addressed with insight as to how these failures can be overcome to further improve cycle life. These results demonstrates that stable cycling of dendrite free lithium metal is possible in simple anode free cells with liquid electrolytes which represents a promising and practical avenue for the design of high energy density batteries.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>  </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"192fig1.jpeg\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>"}

Localized Superconcentrated Electrolytes (LSEs) are derived from HCEs but contain a co-solvent that is used to dissipate the solvent-salt complexes, leading to significantly reduced viscosity and therefore improved conductivity. One of these co-solvents is 1,1,2,2-Tetrafluoroethyl 2,2,3,3-Tetrafluoropropyl Ether (TTE). They can be prepared using solvents that have a high anodic stability such as Sulfolane (SL) making them ideal candidates for cycling lithium metal in conjunction with advanced cathode materials above 4,5 V. Since the introduction of the LSE concept, proposed by Jiangfeng <jats:italic>et al. </jats:italic>\n                  <jats:italic>[1]</jats:italic> most published variations used Lithium bis(fluorosulfone)imid (LiFSI) as the conducting lithium salt [2]. The structurally similar salt Lithium bis-(trifluoromethanesulforyl)imid (LiTFSI) is commonly used in classical electrolytes, especially for Lithium-Sulfur batteries because of its good ion separation and resulting high conductivity. It has however rarely been used in LSEs to date [3]. Although LiFSI and LiTFSI are very similar in structure, in contact with lithium metal their decomposition products display significant differences and can therefore lead to drastic divergencies in lithium passivation and deposition behavior [4, 5]. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this study we present a comparison of LSEs containing LiFSI and/or LiTFSI. The kinetics of Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) formation is investigated by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and differences in SEI composition are discerned using X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Resulting divergencies in SEI stability and morphology of cycled Lithium metal are being investigated by Galvanostatic Cycling and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) while principal conclusions are being drawn from Nernst-Potentials and solvent complex geometries obtained by Density Functional Theory (DFT). </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Our results show that the main LiTFSI decomposition fragment form a SEI that is unsuitable for efficient cycling of lithium metal in a HCE. This however can be remedied by applying the LSE principle to it where the stoichiometric addition of TTE improves the electrolytes electrochemical performance, so that a stable SEI can be formed on lithium metal. Because of its comparatively high conductivity it would be advantageous to use the LiTFSI based LSE over a FSI-based one. To further enhance the LSE multiple commonly employed electrolyte additives are being considered. In this regard results from EIS, XPS and galvanostatic cycling are correlated with theoretical predictions obtained from DFT calculations. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In conclusion, this study highlights the influence of TTE on the formation of the SEI in the presence of LiTFSI. The co-solvent TTE serves a double purpose: dissipating solvent-salt complexes while simultaneously acting as additive during the initial passivation phase. Further, our results show that additives, that are applied in common electrolytes do not necessarily work the same way when used in an LSE, sometimes deteriorating the SEI rather than improving it. The reason for this is that the chemical nature of a SEI significantly differs when formed from SL based electrolytes compared to ones containing 1,3-Dioxolan or ethylene carbonate. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> \n                  <jats:list list-type=\"simple\">\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p> Qian J, Henderson WA, Xu W et al.

However, the practical implementation of Li-S battery can be achievable only when several critical problems are well addressed, which involve the insulting nature of cathode materials, the unruly polysulfide shuttling behavior, low efficiency of metallic lithium redox reactions, etc. These bugbears have been haunting the Li-S system and obstructing its access to practically high capacity and long lifespan. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Targeting at these problems, we have long been committed to pursuing high-efficiency Li-S electrochemistry with extensive research interests in multiple battery ingredients. Following the two strategic emphasis on conduction properties and sulfur confinement, a series of functional host materials with delicate nano-/micro-structures has been successfully developed to fulfill fast and durable sulfur electrochemistry, which enables high sulfur loading and minimum electrolyte with achievable energy density that meets the commercial benchmark. Beyond that, targeted surface functionalization has been dedicated on separator to regulate the diffusion behavior of polysulfide, while host strategy with rationally-designed architecture has been also employed in lithium anode to suppress the dendrite formation and enhance the redox reversibility.

Modest molybdenum doping produces a significant electronic conductivity increase (e.g. 1 mS cm-1 for MoLTO vs 10-7 mS.cm-1 for LTO) that is thought to reflect a partial Ti4+ reduction to Ti3+ with charge compensation by the Mo6+ dopant, producing a stable mixed-valent Ti4+/3+ state.

While existing lithium-ion cells show adequate performance in many devices, there is an ever-expanding number of new technologies that call for higher performing secondary batteries. Unfortunately, the use of metallic lithium in batteries poses several safety issues, particularly when used in conjunction with conventional organic electrolytes<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>. A potential pathway to commercialisation of lithium-metal batteries (LMB\u2019s) lies with the choice of electrolyte, and specifically the incorporation of ionic liquids<jats:sup>2-3</jats:sup>. However, due to the large number of cation-anion pairs possible, it can be quite time consuming and prohibitively expensive to experimentally screen all potential combinations. By gaining an understanding of the interaction occurring between the lithium and the ionic liquid cations and anions on the atomic scale, the electrolyte structure can be appropriately modified to tune the physical properties and obtain the desired behaviour and performance in a device. Incorporation of sulfonyl-based anions such as TFSI<jats:sup>-</jats:sup> and FSI<jats:sup>-</jats:sup> have shown promising properties for lithium-based cells<jats:sup>4-5</jats:sup>. Unfortunately, such materials have proven to be quite costly compared to traditional organic solvents, therefore, new anions need to be considered.

In order to stabilize the electrodeposited Li metal for safe and high energy batteries, highly concentrated electrolytes (solvate electrolytes) have been proposed to suppress the formation of Li dendritic structure and polysulfide dissolution in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. (1-5) In this talk, we use in situ transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM) to study the effect of solvate electrolyte on Li plating/stripping process. In situ TXM images show that electrodeposited Li particles with uniform density are formed in solvate electrolyte during initial plating process. The effect of solvate electrolyte on the mechanism of Li growth is studied in detail. Additionally, in situ spectroscopy including Raman and X-ray spectroscopy (X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy) are used to investigate sulfur reaction mechanism and the interaction between polysulfide and solvate electrolyte. We found that the sulfur species formed in the solvate electrolyte are different from the sulfur species formed in conventional DOL/DME electrolyte. These results suggest that solvate electrolyte changes both polysulfide solubility and sulfur reaction mechanism.

In the screening of new technologies, Lithium-Sulfur (Li\u2013S) batteries are one of the most promising candidates among rechargeable battery systems due to its reduced cost, low toxicity, and high theoretical specific energy and specific capacity. However, there are still several limitations that need to be overcome before Li-S batteries are feasible for commercialization. One of the main drawbacks of this technology is the \u201cshuttle\u201d effect \u2013 migration of soluble polysulfide species (PS) from the cathode to the anode, where are reduced to Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S, resulting in the formation of an SEI layer that can passivate the lithium anode. In addition, the use of liquid organic electrolytes rises safety concerns due to their flammability. For this reason, inorganic solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are being explored as an alternative because unlike liquid organic-based electrolytes, SSEs are usually non-flammable and have the potential to suppress PS shuttle and Li dendrites. However, when working with SSEs, the compatibility between the electrodes and the SSEs is critical. Such compatibility is determined by the properties of the electrode/electrolyte interface. A good interface between an SSE and electrode requires fast ion transport, maximum contact area, and chemical stability during cycling. Therefore, it is imperative to gain insights regarding the SSE/Sulfur-cathode interface. In this work, we use density functional theory (DFT) and <jats:italic>ab initio</jats:italic> molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations in order to study the SSE/S-cathode interface.

Here, two states of charge of the cathode (non- and fully-lithiated) in contact with the SSEs models are studied. Reaction mechanisms, the structure of the interface, and charge transfer evolution are carefully examined and characterized in detail. Finally, interfacial and surface energies are provided as descriptors of stability and compatibility of the electrode/cathode interfaces.  </jats:p>"}

Difficulties with passivation and polysulfide shuttle have traditionally plagued the lithium anode and sulfur cathode, respectively, in conventional liquid electrolyte batteries. Solid-state electrolytes, such as lithium garnets, can largely address these issues as the dense ceramic layer helps block polysulfide shuttle and are stable to metallic lithium. However, poor electron transfer kinetics resulting from high electronic resistance and large volumetric changes of sulfur limit the development of solid-state Li-S batteries. At intermediate temperatures, the diffusivity of sulfur is thermally activated, facilitating electron transfer. Here we mimic encapsulated sulfur through infiltration of sulfur, carbon, and a series of binders into one side of a porous-dense-porous garnet structure. The garnet provides ionic conduction through the cell while helping to entrap sulfur with aid of binder. Cell cycling was performed to determine the effect of binder on specific capacity and capacity fade. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to elucidate the changes occurring within the cathode. While the pore size is larger than what is used for most encapsulated sulfur cathodes, thermal activation allows certain binder systems enhanced performance. In addition to conductive benefits, this large-scale enclosure of sulfur helps avoid corrosion issues possible with sulfur at elevated temperature.  </jats:p>"}

Usually the electrolyte was much heavier than the carbon materials in the cathode, which made the practical energy density of Li-air battery lower than that of Li-ion batteries.

The polymeric layer corresponding to the shell was prepared by a Layer-by-Layer (LbL) coating method utilizing Li-Nafion and PDDA-Cl (poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)) together. Several bi-layers of Li-Nafion and PDDA on the CNTs surface were successfully prepared and characterized with XPS, FT-IR, and TGA. The porous structure of the CNTs was found to remain after LbL process, which was confirmed by a nitrogen adsorption/desorption profile and BJH pore size distribution analysis. The porous structure could act as the oxygen channels facilitating the transport of oxygen molecules to react with Li ions on cathode surface. These polymeric bi-layers could provide Li ion pathway after absorbing a small amount of ionic liquid electrolyte, 0.5M LiTFSI EMI-TFSI (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide). Compared with typical cathode where only liquid electrolytes were employed, the total amount of electrolyte in the cathode could be significantly reduced, thus the overall cell energy density could be increased. A Li-air battery with this core-shell structured cathode exhibited a high energy density, ~390 Wh/kg, which was assessed by directly weighing all cell components together including GDL (gas diffusion layer), an interlayer (a separator containing a mixture of LiTFSI, 1-Butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (PYR-14) and PDDA-TFSI), lithium anode and LbL-CNTs cathode.

When metallic lithium is in contact with the electrolyte, a surface layer called SEI (Solid Electrolyte Interface) is formed. In a conventional Li-ion battery with graphite-based anode, the SEI layer is a passivation interface that will help to stabilize the battery<jats:italic>.</jats:italic> However, when considering Li metal anodes, the SEI is unable to maintain a uniform plating and stripping of Li. During charge/discharge processes the SEI breaks, continuously exposing fresh lithium surface to the electrolyte, leading to an irreversible capacity loss and the formation of dendrites. The latter are nanostructured formations that can grow on the anode surface until reaching the cathode surface and originating the fatal failure of the cell [1]. There are many approaches that aim to improve the stabilization of the Li metal surface. The use of solid electrolytes can inhibit the growth of dendrites while electrolyte additives are used to form a more stable SEI. An alternatively approach is the direct modification of the metallic Li surface to form a designed passivation layer before being in contact with the electrolyte [2]. However, despite all these efforts, the interfacial chemistry of these surfaces and interfaces are currently still not well understood. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In order to find a suitable solution for the stabilization of the lithium surface, it is essential to have a full understanding of the nature and characteristics of its high reactivity. For this purpose, one of the preliminary steps is to analyze the effects that atmospheric gases, such as carbon dioxide gas, oxygen gas and water, have on the surface of Li metal. Although there are a lot of studies from the last decades analyzing these interactions using a wide range of tools of both theoretical and experimental methods that propose interesting reaction mechanisms [3], little has been done using <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> experiments. There is still a lack of knowledge in terms of understanding the mechanism behind the reaction of metallic lithium with atmospheric gases. Ambient Pressure X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (APXPS) is an ideal tool to explore this phenomenon. Being a chemically specific surface sensitive technique, it allows determining which components are present on the first nanometers of the surface of the metal. Furthermore, ambient pressure studies make it possible to follow the reactions <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>.

Thanks to the use of soft X-rays (<jats:italic>hv</jats:italic> &lt; 800 eV), it is an extremely surface sensitive technique that can operate from Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) conditions up to pressure &lt; 1 Torr. Our recent studies done were focused on the effect that carbon dioxide gas, oxygen gas and water vapor produce on the surface of UHV cleaned metallic lithium. We clearly observe two regimens in the growth of the layer for the three gases, a reaction controlled regime and a diffusion controlled regime, in good agreement with recent studies [4]. These two regimens can be observed in the Figure 1 for CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> gas at 10 mTorr and at 0.1 mTorr.

The FAS treatment allows for control of graphene structural order and chemical uniformity not possible through prior top-down wet methods. Graphite is exfoliated into single-nm scale thickness graphene that is nearly defect free (at-edge sonication graphene \"AES-G\") or is highly defective (in-plane sonication graphene \"IPS-G\"). The AES-G has a Raman G/D band intensity ratio of 14.3 and an XPS derived oxygen content of 1.3 at.%, while the IPS-G has I<jats:sub>G/D </jats:sub>of 1.6 and oxygen content of 6.2 at.%. Graphene and related carbons are widely employed as templates and protection layers to improve metal plating behavior in sodium and lithium metal battery (SMBs, LMBs) anodes. We then use AES-G and IPS-G to examine the role of structure and chemistry of graphene supports in promoting efficient Na metal cycling. The graphene serves a dual role in stabilizing the Na metal anode, being a nucleation template and serving as a protective layer to keep the metal from severely reacting with the electrolyte. We are the first to demonstrate that graphene defects are actually quite deleterious for efficient Na plating and stripping. AES-G yields state-of-the-art Na performance, with stable cycling at 2 mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> at 100% Coulombic efficiency (CE), and an areal capacity of 1 mAh/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. Meanwhile IPS-G performs on-par with the baseline Cu support in terms of severe charging instability. The explanation is that the defective graphene demonstrates much more copious SEI formation due to its defects and oxygen groups being catalytic. A thicker SEI results in a larger overpotential and worse CE loss during subsequent Na plating/stripping, manifesting in severe mossy metal dendrite growth and periodic electrical shorts. We therefore propose the following design rule for next-generation supports for Na metal: An ideal architecture will not only possess a large surface area for copious preferred heterogenous nucleation, but itself will be non-catalytic for SEI formation.  </jats:p>"}

However, the instability of Li metal towards liquids electrolytes, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, and dendritic lithium have caused significant safety concerns that have inhibited its commercialization [1]. It is believed that artificial SEI layers formed through various techniques can stabilize the Li metal interface and enable stable electrochemical cycling with higher Coulombic efficiency. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) and molecular layer deposition (MLD) are nanoscale coating techniques that are capable of controlling the interfacial chemistry down to the atomic level [2]. Herein, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in enabling high performance Li metal anodes for next-generation battery systems. Various polymeric protective coatings are synthesized on Li metal by MLD to enable prolonged lifetime and cycling stability. Metalcones including Alucone and Zircone are explored and shown to greatly enhance the performance of Li-S and Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> systems [3]. Moreover, the ability to fine tune the composition of artificial SEI layers is exemplified by combining ALD/MLD techniques to form hybrid organic/inorganic protection layers to further improve the stability of the Li metal anode. The performance of the protected Li metal anodes are optimized in various electrolyte systems to achieve long life times at relatively high current densities in symmetrical cells and full cells. Furthermore, a better understanding of the role of these organic/inorganic polymeric films are gained through advanced ex-situ and in-situ characterization techniques, providing insight into the mechanism of improved performance.

However, the repeated SEI breaking induced by the uninterrupted volume change during Li plating and the formation of new SEI consumes the limited Li obtained only from the cathode and electrolyte and leads to a rapid capacity fading and low Coulombic Efficiency (CE). Here, we report that the combined effect between potential electrolytes and cyclic protocols could suppress the amount of Li and electrolyte consumed in the SEI formation process and prolongs cycle life of such an anode free battery (AFB) [Cu||LFP-type] at a high current density. In comparison to the carbonate based commercial 1MLiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>, the synergy between the laboratory prepared ether based 3M LiFSI electrolyte and our new cycling protocol significantly enhanced the cyclic performance of AFB having the Cu||LiFePO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> Cu||Li half-cell at high current density. Eventually, Cu||Li half-cell manifested extraordinary cyclic performance and cycled up to 1000 cycles with the average CE of more than 99.9% at a high current density of 1.0 mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> using bare Cu without any modification. In addition, the Cu||LiFePO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> showed a remarkable cyclic performance at 0.2 mA/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> attaining an average CE of up to 98.99% retaining more 40% of the initial discharge capacity after 100 cycles. More importantly, the Cu||LiFePO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> also cycled<jats:sub> </jats:sub>a higher rate up to 1.0 mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> with high CE and retaining a reasonable discharge capacity after 100 cycles. The fast cycling and stable performance these cells attributed to the formation robust, flexible and inorganic components rich conductive SEI on the surface of the in-situ deposited Li by the synergistic effect between our laboratory prepared electrolyte and the new cycling protocol. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>\n                     <jats:italic>Keyword: </jats:italic>\n                  </jats:bold>\n                  <jats:italic>anode free, synergy, cycling protocol, ether based electrolyte<jats:bold>, </jats:bold>Cu||LiFePO<jats:sub>4, </jats:sub>SEI</jats:italic>  \n               </jats:p>"}

This effective treatment can lead to well\u2010controlled nucleation and the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI).

Polymer electrolyte with high lithium transference number and high modulus would substantially mitigate dendrite growth in lithium metal battery. According to previous models, structuring the electrolyte to immobilized the anions with high shear modulus is of the various options to suppress dendrite growth. In this work, we designed a single-ion conductor (SIC) based on a block copolymer using sulfonic anion, whose structure covalently bonded with hydoxylated polyisoprene (named as sPI) to reach high transference number. Polystyrene can be used to support the mechanical properties of matrix and the adjacent polyisoprene with double bond main chain plays a decoupling role (PI(1,4))\u00a0which separate the stiff PS domain, and the lithium conducting sPI domain (referred to SII block copolymer). </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Using small angle X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy, nanostructures of membranes were identified as a bi-continuous network structure.

From galvanostatic cycling experiments, we found that the presence of PS and the sPI in SII membrane in liquid electrolyte with lithium symmetric cell provides over 245 hr in cell life time. Batteries containing SII membranes in liquid electrolyte are able to cycle at least 20 times with high coulombic efficiency (98%). This results warrant that the sPI can effectively delay lithium dendrite formation due to reduced uneven lithium deposition while maintaining the mechanical property with moderate values by adjusting PS and PI(1,4) length, and this architecture design also made the application of SIC in lithium metal polymer battery possible in the future.</jats:p>"}

The high solubility of redox couple circumvents the deposition of insoluble and electrical-insulating product on the carbon anode that has caused large overpotential for Li-O2 batteries. And the cell potentials of these prototypes are much larger than those of Li-S batteries, because of the high redox potential (vs Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>/Li) of the halogen redox couples: 3.6 V for I<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/I- and 4.1 V for Br<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/Br-, compared with 2-2.4 V for polysulfide. Probably the most distinct feature of these new lithium metal battery\u00a0is the use of an aqueous solution as cathode that provides much higher ion conductivity and\u00a0thus better power performance than solid-state cathodes. However, the aqueous electrolyte also poses several challenges to other components of the battery. First, a strictly water-tight ion exchange membrane is needed to\u00a0protect the lithium metal anode\u00a0from the catholyte and any water leakage will cause safety issues considering the violent reaction between lithium and water. Secondly, corrosive I<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> or Br<jats:sub>2 </jats:sub>has to be added to the electrolyte to ensure reversible redox reactions.\u00a0Finally, the small electrochemical window of water limit the further improvement on cell potential. To address these issues with existing aqueous catholyte, this paper proposes an organic catholyte with acetonitrile as solvent, I<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-free ionic liquid as redox active\u00a0species, and carbon nanohorn as additives. Compared with aqueous electrolyte, organic electrolyte has much higher voltage window and poses less safety threat to the lithium metal anode, but unfortunately, it\u00a0also has lower ion conductivity. The carbon nanohorn additives mitigate the low conductivity problems by forming a percolating nanoscale conductive network inside the organic electrolyte.<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> This network extend the reaction site from the surface of the carbon current collector into the bulk of the organic catholyte, hence it reduces the I<jats:sup>-</jats:sup> ion diffusion length to compensate for the lower ion conductivity of organic electrolyte. The good\u00a0electrical conductivity of the carbon nanohorn also reduce the internal resistance of the battery to improve power formances. Last but not the least, the carbon nanohorn has catalytic effect towards the reduction of I<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> to I<jats:sup>-</jats:sup>. As a result,\u00a0even without adding corrosive I<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> to the electrolyte, the I<jats:sup>-</jats:sup> to I<jats:sub>2\u00a0</jats:sub>reduction\u00a0reaction can still proceed with low overpotential. Based on the aforementioned analysis, we developed a novel organic catholyte by mixing carbon nanohorn (CNH)\u00a0into 37 mg/ml acetonitrile solution of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide ([EMIM]I) ionic liquid. The weight ratio between CNH and [EMIM]I is 1:1. The CNH is from Graphene\u00a0Laboratories Inc. Calverton, NY, USA\u00a0and the [EMIM]I (97%) and acetonitrile (anhydrous, 99.8%)\u00a0are from Sigma Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA. All materials and chemicals are used without further processing or purification. To elucidate the effect of CNH additives, 37 mg/ml [EMIM]I in acetonitrile solution are used as a reference catholyte. These two catholyte systems are studied inside a glovebox using a three-electrode beaker cell with glassy carbon of 7.07 mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> area as working electrode, silver wire as non-aqueous reference electrode, and platinum mesh as counter electrode. In cyclic voltammetry study, the cell using CNH-added electrolyte has higher cathodic current (corresponding to reduction of I<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> to I<jats:sup>-</jats:sup>)\u00a0than that of CNH-free cell, demonstrating that this reduction reaction is more facile in the CNH-added cell. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of CNH-added electrolyte at 0.1Hz-100kHz demonstrates lower\u00a0impedance at high frequency region and lower charge transfer resistance in mid-frequency region, which proves that the CNH can reduce the internal resistance of the cell and facilitate the I<jats:sup>-</jats:sup>/I<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> redox reaction as expected. Ongoing work is to assemble the CNH-added electrolyte with lithium metal anode\u00a0and evaluate the lithium metal battery performance. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Reference <jats:list list-type=\"simple\">\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>Lu, Yuhao, John B.

However, in case of the using the lithium metal anode, a growth of lithium metal dendrite is a key problem in order to realize lithium metal secondary batteries. Lithium metal dendrite deposits on lithium metal surface during charging process results in a degradation of battery and an explosion of battery in the worst case. One of origins for lithium metal dendrite formation is a non-uniform current distribution. In our group, to realize uniform current distribution, we have focused on a separator. We have reported that the growth of lithium metal dendrite is suppressed by using polyimide separator with 3-Dimensionally Ordered Macroporous (3DOM) structure. Polyimide (PI) haing high thermal stability was chosen for the separator material. In our previous report, spherical particles of silica were used as the template to form pores. However, hydro fluoric acid (HF), which is very toxic, must be used to remove the silica template particles. In order to reduce manufacturing cost and environmental load, a new process without HF acid process is required. In this study, for a new separator preparation process without using HF acid was developed by using polystyrene (PS) particle as template.

The overvoltage of cell using the 3DOM (PS) PI separator was smaller than that of using PP separator. In case of cell using the PP separator, it is considered that lithium dendrite is formed and is easily peeled from electrode surface associated with cycle number, and then this lithium dendrite may be changed to dead lithium leading to high resistance. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Figure 2 (c) and (d) show the SEM image of Li deposited in cell using PP separator or 3DOM PI separator after 100 cycles, respectively.

Therefore, it has been used for various applications. However, electric power consumption of portable devices increases due to multifunction of devices, year by year. Higher energy density battery is strongly required. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>One of the methods to improve the energy density is utilization of lithium metal for the anode material. Lithium metal has the lowest electrode potential and the highest capacity per unit weight in all elements. However, the electrochemical reaction of lithium metal, which is deposition/dissolution reaction, has the problem such as an occurrence of the internal short circuit between anode and cathode due to a formation of the dendritic lithium metal growth during charging process. Particularly, the internal short circuit by the lithium dendrite is known to cause significant capacity loss and the serious accidents such as burst and firing of cells. It may be said that these phenomena are accelerated by non-uniform reduction of Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>ion at the surface of lithium metal anode. It is important to realize a highly uniform reduction at surface of lithium metal anode to suppress the dendrite growth that is the biggest problem of the lithium metal rechargeable battery. For this purpose, the formation of the large number of uniform reaction site and the lithium ion movement between anode and cathode are seriously required. The test cells with three dimensional ordered macro porous separator (3DOM separator) which has highly homogeneous pores and a high porosity were prepared. These cells can start from the first discharge process. Though, the cathode material for conventional lithium ion battery cannot start from the first discharge. In order to enable the partially first discharge, manganese dioxide, which did not contain lithium, was added as the second cathode material to lithium cobalt oxide as the first cathode material. At the first partial discharge process, lithium metal dissolved into electrolyte to form many holes at the surface of lithium metal anode. The 3DOM separator provides uniform current distribution to the lithium metal surface during the first discharge. A large number of pores formed on the anode surface can be used as a reaction site of the deposition/dissolution reaction of lithium metal, and it is expected that a local growth of large lithium dendrite is suppressed.

Firstly, the cells were discharged to 2.0 V at 0.1 CA. After that, the cycle performance was evaluated. The cells were charged by 0.5 CA constant current followed by constant voltage charge at 4.3 V until the current reduced to 0.05 CA. Then the cells were discharged to 2.0 V at 0.5 CA. The temperature was at 25 \u00b0C. The cycle performance was shown in Figure 2. It was confirmed that cycle performance improved as increasing added manganese dioxide percentage in the cathode material. Many reaction sites may be formed on the lithium metal surface of anode with increasing first discharge capacity. The battery performance was not still sufficient for a practical battery, optimization of kinds and quantity, composition of second cathode material, and adjustment of the electrolyte composition and concentration of lithium salt are necessary. In addition, the safety of lithium metal rechargeable cell should be tested.

This system consists of a lithium metal protected by a water-stable lithium conducting solid electrolyte, aqueous electrolyte, and a carbon air electrode.

One requirement is to develop a protected lithium electrode, which can perform a lithium stripping/deposition with a long lifespan in aqueous electrolyte. The key point of the electrode is in adopting a NASICON-type lithium conducting solid electrolyte, Li<jats:sub>1+x+y</jats:sub>Al<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>Ti<jats:sub>2-x</jats:sub>P<jats:sub>3-y</jats:sub>Si<jats:sub>y</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>12, </jats:sub>(LATP), as the protect layer which covers and isolates lithium metal from contacting directly with aqueous electrolytes. LATP is unstable in a direct contact with lithium metal, so that a buffer layer should be placed between lithium metal and LATP.  </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> In the early stage of our study, polymer electrolyte was adopted for the buffer layer. The interfacial resistance between lithium metal and polymer electrolytes has been demonstrated a key factor in initiating lithium dendrite formation by addition of ionic liquids, oligomer ethers and/or nanofillers. All these additives can reduce the interfacial resistance substantially and prolong the onset time of lithium dendrite initiation. One main approach to enhance electrode kinetics is to use ether-oligomer solvent without polymeric counterpart. A novel electrolyte prepared by the complexation of lithium cations supplied by lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether with the co-solvent of 1,3-dioxolane give metallic lithium anodes with high specific areal capacity in the absence of lithium dendrite formation.  </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Along with this buffer material, lithium ion conducting solid electrolyte that is stable in aqueous solution is another key component of aqueous lithium-air batteries.

For its practical applications the solid electrolyte film thickness must be minimized to obtain a high gravimetric and volumetric energy density, while higher ionic conductivity is required to reduce ohmic resistance. We have developed a solid electrolyte thin film using a tape casting method.  </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> In addition to the detailed studies of those materials, other important materials about carbon air cathode, mechanisms, and the direction of future development will be mentioned in this presentation.  </jats:p>"}

The adoption of batteries in large-scale applications will accelerate if some of the key limitations of current lithium-ion technology can be addressed: cost, energy density, cycle-life, and safety. In spite of these limitations, the growth of lithium-ion battery industry is noteworthy. Tesla, a relatively small car company in California, is gearing up to build a factory that will produce 50% of lithium batteries worldwide. Today virtually every major car company has a stake in the electric car arena. An important milestone for improving lithium batteries is the quest to replace the graphite anode by lithium metal. In 2007, Hany Eitouni and Mohit Singh, and I founded a company called Seeo to commercialize all-solid batteries with a lithium metal anode. It was based on stabilizing the lithium anode using a block copolymer electrolyte developed by Singh and Eitouni when they were students in my lab. In 2007, enabling the lithium metal anode was not high on the priority list of major battery manufacturers. It was thus difficult to engage in meaningful partnerships with them. The situation is different today. While difficulties surrounding the lithium metal anode are widely recognized, enabling it represents the most credible path for increasing the specific energy of lithium batteries substantially beyond that of lithium-ion chemistry. Cells with specific energies comparable to gasoline such as lithium-sulfur and lithium-air are all dependent on a stable lithium metal anode. A new battery venture called Blue Current that I started with my co-inventor, Joe DeSimone and Alex Teran in 2014 hopes to take all-solid batteries to the next level. I will use my start-up experience to indicate what I think the roles of government labs, universities, and small businesses are in the emerging clean energy landscape. Deployment of clean energy on scale remains a daunting challenge; partnerships involving different segments of society are our best hope for addressing this challenge.</jats:p>"}

Cathode passivation by discharge products is one of the most serious drawbacks of such batteries, along with the slow O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>mass transport, which in the case of air breathing cells, limits current densities to one order of magnitude lower than the values for commercial LIBs [1]. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In order to obviate these issues, novel configurations of Li/O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> battery, like the Li Redox Flow Air Battery (LRFAB), are under development [2, 3]. The use of an O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>- based catholyte that is continuously fed with O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, from air or from an external O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> tank, renders cell discharge capacity less dependent on catholyte volume with respect to conventional RFBs. Indeed, the electrolyte is only a carrier for O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>and this is beneficial to size and weight reduction. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The use of semi-solid electrodes has been shown to be successful for Li-ion, Li/polysulfides, Na-ion flow batteries and for flow supercapacitors [4-7]. These studies pointed to the demonstration that changing cell configuration by substituting solid electrodes with semi-solid, fluidic slurries is an effective strategy that improves battery rate response. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Here, we report a new battery concept, a non-aqueous Semi-Solid Lithium Redox Flow Air (O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) Battery (SLRFAB) [8-9]. The catholyte is a suspension of high surface area carbon in O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-saturated non-aqueous electrolyte. Oxygen reduction takes place on the semi-solid electroactive particles dispersed in the catholyte, avoiding the electrode passivation, enhancing the capacity and, in turn, the delivered energy. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Exceptionally high capacity is achieved at voltages &gt;2.6 V vs Li/Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> and high discharge rates (&gt; 2.5 mA cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup>) of interest for practical applications.

The second and more detrimental issue that limits Li-S cell performance is interfacial stability and cycling reversibility of lithium metal anode, which easily reacts with both electrolyte solvents and the formed polysulfides during battery cycling and leads to unavoidable shuttle and continuous consumption of active sulfur species. These side reactions are significantly exacerbated under conditions of coupling with high-areal loading sulfur cathode and/or cycled at elevated current densities.

[1, 2] In this paper, we have attempted at synthesizing cathode material LiCoO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on the surface of Au coated solid electrolyte, Li<jats:sub>6.75</jats:sub>La<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>Zr<jats:sub>1.75</jats:sub>Nb<jats:sub>0.25</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> (LLZNb), by electrodeposition and subsequent sintering. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> LLZNb was synthesized by solid phase method. Electrodeposition was carried out under a cathodic polarization of 1.7 V in 2M CoSO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> solution at 40\u02daC with bubbling oxygen gas. Obtained cobalt oxide film was sintered at 650\u02daC for 12h after dipping LiOH solution. The products were identified by XRD and Raman spectroscopy.

But lithium dendrites formed during recharge (electrodeposition at the anode) could short-circuit the battery and lead to fires and explosions. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to modify the composition of electrolytes and the surface of lithium electrodes, but mainly improved the stability of lithium under small currents and low capacities. Here, we devise a Li symmetric cell in a fine glass capillary, and the\u00a0<jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>\u00a0observations reveal that the morphology of lithium deposit changes from a dense porous (mossy) structure to needle-like (dendritic) structure at Sand\u2019s time, when the concentration of electrolyte decreases to zero at the surface of the electrode. Further experiments in sandwich cells of Li|Separator(Electroylte)|Li confirm that mossy lithium can be completely blocked by anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane until Sand\u2019s time, when a sudden voltage jump stimulates dendritic lithium to form, penetrate the nanopores of AAO and then short the cell, just like the behavior of transport-limited dendritic growth of copper. By creating a free compartment on each side of the AAO membrane, our sandwich cells can stably cycle at much higher current densities and capacities, e.g. at 5mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>\u00a0for 5mAh/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>.

However, interfacial charge transfer resistance (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>CT</jats:sub>) between Li and LLZO is a main issue when employ metallic Li as anode, which would be strongly affected by interfacial contact. Recently, many researchers have shown the charger transfer resistance are attributed to poor interface contact between electrode/electrolyte, surface morphology and particle size of electrolyte [2, 3]. Therefore, it is important to understand the fundamental electrochemical properties at the interface, and simultaneously it is necessary to improve the intimate interface between Li and LLZO. In the present work, we investigated the influence of surface roughness of the Li<jats:sub>6.5</jats:sub>La<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>Zr<jats:sub>1.5</jats:sub>Ta<jats:sub>0.5</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> (LLZT) pellets and heat treatment on <jats:italic>R</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>CT. </jats:sub>The effect of lithium and gold thin layers deposited on the LLZT pellets to form the favorable contact between Li and LLZT was also studied. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Experimental </jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The LLZT pellets with a relative density of 96% were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction and following spark plasma sintering technique with a sintering temperature of 1000\u00b0C, pressure of 0.3 MPa for 10 minutes. The surfaces of the sintered pellets were polished using several pieces of emery paper with grit numbers progressing from 400 to 8000 in an Ar-filled glovebox to avoid moisture and carbon dioxide in air. The surface morphology of the pellets were observed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and scanning probe microscope (SPM). A Li|LLZT|Li symmetric cell was assembled by sandwiching a LLZT pellet with Li metal foils (\u02785 mm) and Cu thin foils. Dimensions of the pellet was around 1.5-mm thick and 10 mm in diameter. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) washers were used to avoid the deformation of lithium by pressure and heat, and estimated pressure on the Li|LLZT|Li cell was 1.4 MPa. <jats:italic>R</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>CT</jats:sub>at the Li|LLZT interfaces was characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz in the temperature range from 25\u00b0C to 175\u00b0C~180\u00b0C. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Results and discussion</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:italic>R</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>CT</jats:sub> at the Li|LLZT interface was compared for each emery paper at RT after preconditioning at 175\u00b0C as shown in Fig. 1. EIS analysis clearly indicates decreases in <jats:italic>R</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>CT </jats:sub>with increasing grit number from #400 to #8000. This is due to differences in surface roughness of the pellets, which affect contact area. It was revealed that <jats:italic>R</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>CT</jats:sub> for the pellet polished with #4000 was as high as 700 \u03a9 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> with rather high activation energy of 0.5 eV. To further improve <jats:italic>R</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>CT</jats:sub> for practical application, two approaches were followed up: one is to increase the electronic conductivity of the LLZT surface. Thin gold layers (ca. 20 nm) were prepared as a current collector between Li and LLZT by vacuum deposition. In this case, <jats:italic>R</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>CT</jats:sub> could be further reduced (triangle in Fig. 1). The decrease in interfacial resistance was attributable to facilitate more charge transfer at the interface. The other approach is to increase surface contact area between Li and LLZT with densely packed interfaces. For that, a thin lithium layer was prepared at the interface by vacuum deposition. Pellet polished with #400 showed decrease in <jats:italic>R</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>CT</jats:sub> compared with a pellet polished with #4000, and further decrease to lowest value (68 \u03a9 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>)<jats:sup> </jats:sup>after heat treatment as shown in Fig. 2. Thus, we conclude that the better modifications are effective to establish the favorable interfaces with large contact area and with good physical adhesion between Li metal and solid electrolyte for the further improvement in electrochemical performance of ASSBs. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Acknowledgement</jats:bold>\n                  <jats:bold>: </jats:bold>This work was partially supported by Advanced Low Carbon Technology Research and Development Program of Japan Science and Technology Agency for the program \u201cSpecially Promoted Research for Innovative Next Generation Batteries (JST -ALCA-SPRING)\u2019\u2019. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>References </jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>1.

However, extensive research has indicated that dendritic growth and severe capacity fade, due to side reactions, during charge and discharge are the two major problems that prevent wide usage of Li-metal as anode in lithium-based batteries[2]. Usage of excessive amount of lithium in the cathode can potentially compensate for the problem of capacity fade without sacrificing energy density. However, the problem of lithium dendrite growth and subsequent short-circuit over multiple cycle remains as major concern[3]. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>During cell fabrication or the first cycle, the Li metal in contact with organic solvent and electrolyte forms a passivating film, which is also known as the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer (see Figure 1). Experimental studies indicate that presence of stiff inorganic compounds (LiF, Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>CO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) within the solid electrolyte interface layer can potentially retard the growth of dendrites for a few cycles (approximately tens of cycles)[4]. On the contrary, all the existing theories proposed to understand the growth of dendrite tend to ignore the effect of the SEI. Similarly, stiff artificial SEI\u2019s are also envisioned as a means of protecting the Li metal from dendrite formation[5].

There exist at least four different parameters that can significantly impact the stress and fracture of the SEI layer: i) Width of the lithium nucleus (W), ii) Height of the dendritic protrusion (H), iii) Thickness of the protection layer (t<jats:sub>SEI</jats:sub>), and iv) Elastic modulus of the protection layer (shear modulus has been investigated here, G<jats:sub>SEI</jats:sub>).

To analyze discharged products in details, the porous cathode is washed with D<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O and the solution is subjected to <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR spectroscopy. Besides that, the \ufb01eld emission scanning electron microscope is employed to observe the morphologies with different DODs (depth of discharge) and discharge/charge stages. Combined with SEM figures, the tested products can be observed directly and visually, which help us understand better how the products formation/decomposition influences the performance of LOBs. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] Z.Q.

Some literatures of Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> batteries have reported more than one hundred cycles using DMSO-based electrolytes. This good cycling performance is based on the stable charge-discharge behavior on the cathode reaction. In general, the coulombic amount used during cycling in Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> cells is much smaller than the electrochemical equivalent of a lithium anode introduced in the battery cell. This charge-discharge sequence can focus on the cycling efficiency on the cathode reaction, but it ignores the coulombic efficiency of a lithium anode. The coulombic efficiency of lithium metal anodes in DMSO-based electrolytes is inherently poor (&lt;35%), which will definitely become a serious problem for use in Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> cells in large-scale energy storage. In this study, we report a novel electrolyte design for enhancing the cycling performance of a Li anode using highly concentrated DMSO-based electrolyte with an appropriate Li salt.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A CR2032 coin-type cell was used to evaluate the cycling performance of lithium metal anodes. We prepared a nickel foil (12 mm diameter, 99% purity) for use as a working electrode, and as-received lithium foil for use as a counter electrode. For the cycling test, 0.5 mAh cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> of lithium was initially electrodeposited (charged) on the working electrode at 0.2 mA cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> or 1.0 mA cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup>, and the same charge amount of lithium was stripped (discharged) from the working electrode until the voltage reached 1.0 V against a counter electrode\u2019s potential. For the preparation of electrolytes, the dried lithium salts of lithium perchlorate (&gt; 99.0% purity), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (&gt;99.0% purity), lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (&gt;99.5% purity), or lithium nitrate (LiNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) (&gt;99.9% purity) was respectively dissolved into the DMSO solvent. The concentration of each lithium salt in a DMSO solvent was controlled from 1.0 M to 4.0 M.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>One reason for the poor coulombic efficiency of lithium anodes in DMSO-based electrolytes is thought to be the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the lithium surface as a result of side reactions with the electrolyte. Another reason is thought to be the direct reduction of the Li ion-DMSO complex that penetrates the SEI layer since DMSO strongly interacts with Li ions owing to its high Gutmann donor number. In order to form a stable SEI on lithium surface, a selection of lithium salts is revealed to be important. Lithium nitrate which forms an inorganic compound (Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O) instead of soluble product (Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S) on lithium surface shows an enhanced coulombic efficiency which is over 75%, &gt;20% higher than other types of lithium salts regardless of the loading current density. Moreover, it\u2019s revealed that the amount of free DMSO molecules in the electrolyte should be reduced to obtain further improved cycling performance of a lithium anode. As shown in Fig. 1, a highly concentrated electrolyte of 4.0 M LiNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/DMSO which has hardly any free DMSO molecules achieved enhanced cycling performance which is over one hundred cycles with an average coulombic efficiency of 84.3%, which had not previously been reported. This enhancement is due to the absence of free DMSO solvent in the electrolyte and the promotion of the desolvation of Li ions on the SEI surface. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>  </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"748fig1.jpeg\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>"}

Here the systematic investigation of the stability of the anode/electrolyte interface in Li\u2010S batteries with concentrated electrolytes containing various lithium salts is reported. It is found that Li\u2010S batteries using LiTFSI\u2010based electrolytes are more stable than those using LiFSI\u2010based electrolytes. The decreased stability is because the N\u2013S bond in the FSI<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup> anion is fairly weak and the scission of this bond leads to the formation of lithium sulfate (LiSO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>) in the presence of polysulfide species.

This fundamental difference in the bond strength of the salt anions in the presence of polysulfide species leads to a large difference in the stability of the anode\u2010electrolyte interface and performance of the Li\u2010S batteries with electrolytes composed of these salts.

In the present work, lithium was electrodeposited in Li[FTA], without gradient of lithium ion concentration, in order to understand further the dendrite growth behavior and its mechanism. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Li[FTA] was used as electrolyte without any solvent.\u00a0Two electrode cells with a 1-mm-gap spacer were constructed, according to the previous report,<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> in an Ar-filled glove box using nickel foil as a working electrode and lithium foil as a counter electrode. A current density from 50 to 1000 \u03bcA cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> was applied for charge density of 1 A s cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> at a temperature of 150 \u00baC. Lithium electrodeposited on working electrode was observed by SEM after washing with dimethyl carbonate or tetrahydrofuran. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Figure 1 shows the SEM images of the working electrode after electrodeposition at a current density of (a) 200 and (b) 1000 \u03bcA cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> for 1 A s cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> at 150 \u00baC, respectively. The current was continually flowed through the cell even at the current density of 1000 \u03bcA cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup>, although the diffusion co-efficient of lithium ion at 150 \u00baC is very small. Note that the current cannot be continuously flowed with the same cell for the binary ionic liquid (PP13[TFSA]+Li[TFSA] (100:10 wt) (PP13; <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>-methyl-<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>-propylpiperidinium, TFSA; bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide)), lithium ion diffusion coefficient (room temperature) of which is similar, since the lithium ion concentration at the working electrode surface gradually decreases to almost zero with such a high current density. The shapes of the deposits are dendritic in the two conditions. The sizes of the deposits are smaller and the number of the deposits is larger when the current density was high. The same tendency was also confirmed with the binary ionic liquid.<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> The number of the deposits in a unit area was rather small compared with literature,<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> which is thought to arise from small charge-transfer resistance leading the small deposition overpotential. Dendritic lithium was observed in this experiment, where there is no change in the lithium-ion concentration in the electrolyte on the working electrode surface during deposition. A more detailed discussion on the mechanism for the dendrite formation is currently underway. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>1. D.

Specifically, we show how an aluminum based layer can react with a lithium dendrite, consumes the available energy, and eventually burns out the lithium dendrite, such that the cell can keep functioning as a fresh cell with no indications of a short in its past cycling.

Here, we report our recent progress in Li-S and Li-Se batteries including S-C and Se-C composite cathodes, Li metal anodes, and the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. In contrast to the extensive studies of the electrochemical behavior of conventional cyclic S<jats:sub>8 </jats:sub>molecules in Li-S batteries, there has been hardly any investigation of the electrochemistry of S chains.

In addition, rational design of S-C composite cathodes with high sulfur loading and remarkable electrochemical properties will also be reported. On lithium metal anode we show that a 3D current collector with a submicron skeleton and high electroactive surface area can significantly improve the electrochemical deposition behavior of Li. Li anode is accommodated in the 3D structure without uncontrollable Li dendrites. We also demonstrate that an arti\ufb01cial SEI layer with high Young\u2019s modulus can restrain Li dendrite growth and reduce the side reaction between Li metal and the organic electrolyte. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References: <jats:list list-type=\"simple\">\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p/>\n                        <jats:p>C.-P.

CoEx uses carefully engineered fluidic channels to cause multiple streams of dissimilar fluids to impart shape to one another. The result is a high-speed, continuous deposition process that can create fine linear structures much smaller than the smallest physical feature within the printhead. By eliminating the small channels necessary for conventional extrusion and injection processes, CoEx is able to deposit highly loaded and viscous pastes at high line speeds under reasonable operating pressures. The CoEx process is capable of direct deposition of features as small as 10 \u03bcm with aspect ratios of 5 or greater, and print speeds &gt; 80 ft/min. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We conduct an analysis on two-dimensional cathode cross-sections in COMSOL and present the electrochemical performance results, including calculated volumetric energy capacity for Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC) co-extruded cathodes, in the presence of a lithium metal anode, polymer separator and\u00a0ethylene carbonate\u2013diethyl carbonate (EC:DEC) liquid electrolyte. The impact of structured electrodes on cell performance is investigated by varying the physical distribution of a fixed amount of cathode mass over a space of dimensions which can be fabricated by CoEx. By systematically varying the thickness and aspect ratio of the electrode structures, we present an optimal subset of geometries and design rules for co-extruded geometries. Modeling results demonstrate that NMC CoEx cathodes, on the order of 125-200 \u00b5m thick, can garner an improvement in material utilization and in turn capacity through the addition of fine width electrolyte channels or highly conductive electrode regions.

Specifically, the lithium-oxygen (Li/O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) based batteries have drawn attention of the researchers as a promising alternative to Li-ion batteries for long range electric vehicles. However, this system suffers from high overpotentials during charge, indicating asymmetrical charge/discharge reaction mechanisms. High charge overpotentials lower the energy efficiency and can increase potential-driven side reactions (e.g., electrolyte decomposition). Furthermore, the discharge product forms as a new solid phase in the cathode by a nucleation and growth process, which is in general different from lithium-ion battery technologies. Thus, a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism is crucial for enhancing battery performance and durability. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Our approach towards understanding the charge/discharge reaction mechanism is by development and exploitation of a continuum model of a lithium-oxygen cell [1]. The one-dimensional computational domain consists of a gas reservoir filled with oxygen, a porous carbon cathode flooded with an organic electrolyte, a porous separator, and a lithium metal anode. We present a multi-step reaction mechanism of the electrochemistry in the cathode, consisting of O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> dissolution, O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> reduction, LiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> precipitation, LiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> disproportionation during discharge (Figure 1, left), as well as Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> electrostripping during charge. In particular, the mechanism is asymmetric with respect to discharge and charge. The model is parameterized by experimental Swagelok cells [2] and galvanostatic cycling simulations are compared to experimental data. Furthermore, possible reasons for the high charge overpotential are analyzed, options to reduce the charge overpotential (e.g. redox mediator) are discussed, and a charge reaction mechanism including a surface-mediated Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2\u00a0</jats:sub>dissolution is proposed (Figure 1, right).\u00a0 </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] D.

These systems present specific features such as reduced surface, high thermal resistance, excellent cycle life, absence of liquid electrolyte, etc. that make them the most suitable energy sources for some emerging applications (real time clock, medical implants, secured smart cards, etc.). All-solid-state microbatteries are realized by successive deposition of thin films with a total thickness of less than 20 \u00b5m. The corresponding manufacturing steps are mainly carried out using physical vapor deposition processes such as thermal evaporation or sputtering, which are commonly used in the microelectronics industry. Each deposited layer is patterned either with shadow mask or photo-lithography step. Shadow masking process involves restrictive steps such as mask alignment and cleaning. Moreover, standard photolithography processes, commonly used in the microelectronics industry, are actually difficult to adapt to microbattery systems considering the high reactivity of active materials, mainly lithium metal and lithiated compounds like LiPON. The use of such techniques, for deposition as well as patterning steps, involves sophisticated equipment leading to high production and maintenance costs. Furthermore, deposition rates of each processing step remains rather low (~ 10 nm mn<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> for sputtering techniques). </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this study, to increase throughput and limit production costs, Lithium anode thin films are deposited via an easy electrochemical route [4-5] using standard carbonate based electrolyte with LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> salt. Deposited films exhibit self-aligned nanorods structure without any dendritic growth. The electrochemical performance of such lithium electrodes is evaluated in coin cell configuration versus silicon thin films and no obvious difference in behavior is observed between electrodeposited lithium thin films and bulk lithium metal foils. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The process is then used to manufacture all-solid-state thin film battery stacks. The lithium anode electrodeposition on non-conductive LiPON layer is possible through the use of very thin Cu layer (Fig1). \u00a0The all solid state micro-battery stack is then composed of a silicon cathode, LiPON as solid electrolyte, copper as conductive layer for the electrodeposition process and electrodeposited lithium as anode material (Fig2). Finally, the electrochemical performance (cycle life, specific capacity and curve shape (Fig3)) is close to those obtained with standard evaporated lithium (without Cu layer). This new lithium film deposition technique is suitable for 3D textured or high roughness substrates and limited to electronic conductive surfaces. In the end, this enables a direct patterning of the lithium anode layer. Therefore, considering that all other microbattery materials can be structured by photolithography, the Li electrodeposition could avoid using shadow masking technique during the all-solid state microbatteries manufacturing process. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:italic>The authors thank ST-Microelectronics and the French Directorate General for Enterprise (DGE) for financial support through the Tours2015 project.</jats:italic>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] J.B.

In spite of the unparalleled theoretical gravimetric energy, lithium-oxygen batteries are still under research because of their insufficient cycle lives. This shortcoming is associated with several entangled fading mechanisms [1,2]: partly irreversible nature of the air-cathode, electrolyte evaporation, unstable lithium anode interface, etc. While the reversibility in air-cathodes has been recently improved significantly by the deepened understanding on the electrode-electrolyte reaction and the integration of diverse catalysts, the stability of the lithium anode interface has received relatively much less attention. The destabilization of the lithium anode interface by crossover of water and oxygen from the air-cathode side can indeed cause as fatal degradation for the cycle life as the irreversibility of the air-cathodes [3]. Here we report that cheap poreless polyurethane separator can effectively prevent this crossover while allowing the selective diffusion of lithium ions by high electrolyte uptake of the polyurethane separator through the interchain space. The polyurethane separator also protects lithium anodes from redox mediators, lithium iodide, used to enhance the reversibility of the air-cathode reaction. Based on the lithium anode protection, a consistent capacity of 600 mAh/g is preserved for more than 200 cycles. This study reveals that in most operation conditions, the destabilization of the lithium anode is more critical for the cycle life than the poor reversibility of air-cathode reaction. The present study can also be readily applicable to many other rechargeable batteries that suffer from similar interfacial degradation by side products from the other electrode.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>\n               <jats:p/>\n               <jats:p>Fig. 1.

The shuttling attribute of Li+ is also rivalled by hydronium ions though limited by aqueous potential window. The transition to lithium anode based systems however, has primarily been stymied by safety concerns owing to the fact that lithium forms dendrites in the process of plating/de-plating. Dendrite formation is a well-known metallurgical phenomenon occurring as a result of several energy minimization processes including preferential growth during crystallization Dendrite formation and growth in lithium are however not well-understood owing to the additional factor of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation(1).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The control of lithium dendrite formation is a veritable challenge that could very well make universal adoption of battery systems possible for both stationary and mobile applications. A number of approaches have previously been proposed for the same with varying degrees of success at addressing the issue (2-7). A common strategy involves the use of polymeric/carbon coatings as a method to address fracture. The coating either aids in preventing dendrite growth by allowing for directed growth or acts as a mechanical barrier to rupture and thus cell-failure. Such an approach however lacks scalability given that there is the associated problem of volumetric change especially in thicker lithium electrodes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this work, a multi-pronged approach has been taken to solve the issue of dendrite formation in thick lithium electrode involving the use of composite lithium anodes (CLAs) suitable for bearing the significant volumetric change associated with lithium plating-deplating while ensuring prevention of dendrite formation. The nature of the composite lithium anodes will be discussed along with electrochemical stability and voltage hysteresis behavior. Figure 1 shows the dendrite-free SEM images of CLA electrodes as evidence of the improved cycling characteristic obtained for composite current collector based lithium electrodes in a half-cell configuration. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>1.

However, so far the many problems with the lithium-sulfur system have not been solved satisfactory.

The aerogels are synthesized via a one-pot method and consist of more than 2/3 sulfur, contained inside a porous few-layered reduced graphene oxide matrix. By combining the graphene-based aerogel cathode with an electrolyte and a lithium metal anode, we demonstrate a lithium-sulfur cell with high areal capacity (more than 3\u2009mAh/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> after 75 cycles), excellent capacity retention over 200 cycles and good sulfur utilization.

The dissolved polysulfide anions, by migration through the electrolyte, may react with the lithium metal anode to form insoluble products on its surface; this process also negatively impacts the battery operation.

Being compact, lightweight and durable, these batteries have contributed to significant enhancement or even enablement of these missions. However, NASA\u2019s future missions, i.e. small planetary rovers, planter probes, small satellites, CubeSats etc., warrant more efficient battery technologies, \u2018beyond Li-ion,\u2019 with higher energy densities. The lithium-sulfur system emerges as the most promising technology because of its high theoretical specific energy (3-4x) compared to Li-ion cells.\u00a0 To address the needs of the future missions, NASA has initiated projects to develop high-energy and long-life lithium-sulfur cells, with a high cell specific energy of 400 Wh/kg, good cycle life of 300 cycles and an ability to operate safely over a wide temperature range of -10 to +30 \u00b0C. Despite its high theoretical energy densities and significant developmental efforts in several laboratories, Li-S technology hasn\u2019t matured yet, mainly due to challenges related to the leaching of reduced products into the electrolyte forming a redox shuttle and also poisoning the lithium anode.

The high theoretical specific energy, the simplicity of preparation and operation of electrochemical cells, the sizable commercial possibilities, and the ever-increasing number of new publications, has directed many groups to Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> battery research. Over the past decade, significant progress in the study of possible Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> battery systems has also prompted interest from the chemical and automotive industries. Nevertheless, practical Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> batteries are far from realization. \u00a0 </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Many scientific challenges are related to the oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). In aprotic Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> cells the general assumption is that during discharge, oxygen is reduced on the cathode to form insoluble lithium oxide compounds. Experimental evidence support that the major final product is lithium peroxide (Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>). Nevertheless, the electrolyte solution and the carbon cathode instability toward reduced oxygen species lead to intrinsic instability and irreversible formation of many side products.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Electrochemical formation of Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> can proceed in two ways: (i) One electron transfer to molecular oxygen to form LiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, which continues to react by receiving another electron and Li ion to form Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. (ii) Two electron transfer pathway that skip over the formation of LiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, and forms directly Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. Besides the electrochemical routes, Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> can be formed chemically by disproportionation of Li-superoxide to form molecular oxygen as the second product. In fact, electrochemically formed LiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is unstable, its further reaction to form Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is fast<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>.<jats:sub> </jats:sub>The possibility of isolating lithium superoxide and to assess its lifetime in different aprotic media are still under investigation. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The rout which Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is being formed can affect the growth mechanism. Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is insoluble in aprotic solvents, thus during ORR, crystalline Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is deposit on the cathode surface. When fully covered by ORR products, the continuation of the process depends on electrons crossing the product layer to reach fresh oxygen molecules. Due to poor electronic conductivity of the oxygen reduction product layer, the cathode is deactivated and the ORR is terminated after the deposition of a few layers of Li-peroxide. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The stabilization of superoxide intermediate can change the growth mechanism of the Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> layer. In contrast to lithium peroxide, superoxide radical can be soluble in aprotic solvents that contain lithium cations. During discharge, oxygen is reduce to superoxide through a free cathode site. Then, the charged radical can diffuse in the solution and transfer charge or to disproportionate in all dimensions, leading to a thick deposits of Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. This mechanism can be considered as a top down growth, as superoxide can disproportionate on top of a Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> particle. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Using aprotic solvents with high Guttman donor number such as DMSO, DMF, and DMA in Li-oxygen cells can help to extend the superoxide lifetime. The presence of high DN solvent reduces the electrophilicity (Lewis acidity) of the Li cations and thereby helping to extend the stability of O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n                  <jats:sup>-\u00b7</jats:sup> before <jats:italic>disproportionating </jats:italic>to Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. In practice using high donor number solvents in Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> cells is challenging due to their reactivity toward the lithium metal anode and reduced oxygen species. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Recently it was reported that superoxide radicals can be stabilized indirectly by the electrolytes\u2019 counter anions. In highly associated electrolytes the counter anions are coordinated to the solvated lithium cations, these interactions practically reduce the lithium cations Lewis acidity and thereby temporarily preventing them to bind to the reduced oxygen moieties. As a result, soluble species such as superoxide can take part in the growth mechanism of Li-peroxide deposits on the cathode surface. In this manner we can stabilize superoxide moieties, lead to massive Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> deposition by in a top-down mechanism (i.e. high ORR capacity) although using relatively low DN number solvents such as glymes - CH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O(CH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>CH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O)<jats:sub>n</jats:sub>CH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>.

Li-ion electrode materials, which dictate attainable battery energy densities, used in these batteries have changed little in the past decades, and therefore physical limits in Li-ion battery pack energy density are being approached given the enormous development efforts in the field. \u00a0In this work, we take a close look at molten salt lithium batteries and in particular alkali metal nitrate/nitrite molten salt electrolytes which exhibit low melting point temperature, high ionic conductivity, high thermal stability and good interfacial properties against lithium metal anode. More specifically, we investigated the O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> electrode electrochemical behavior as well as the reduction of nitrates on metal and metal oxide nanoparticles to form lithium oxide and nitrites. The results reported herein provide a potentially transformative approach to enable a rechargeable Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> battery chemistry through the use of inorganic molten salts as electrolytes. Building on our previous foundational research, in which we identified that all organic electrolytes are incompatible with the reversible Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> electrochemistry, the electrolyte compositions reported here do not contain unstable organic solvents. As a result, the reversibility of the Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> electrochemistry reported here is unprecedented. \u00a0Another approach developed at Liox Power, Inc. is the use of nitrates as electroactive material, or in other words, as both the electrolyte and the cathode material.

A Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> interlayer was also deposited between cathode and solid electrolyte by PLD. Electrochemical measurements were performed by using liquid electrolyte (1M LiClO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> in propylene carbonate) and lithium metal anode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was carried out from 3.2 V to 4.4 V at 0.1 mV/s. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was performed at 3.9 V, 4.0 V, 4.1 V, 4.2 V, 4.3 V and 4.4 V with a 30 mV amplitude during first charge and discharge cycle. The frequency range of EIS was limited from 10<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> to 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> Hz. DR-XAS measurements were conducted using the BL37XU beamline, SPring-8, Japan, with a two-dimensional pixel array detector, PILATUS (Dectris, Switzerland). </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Comparing to the thin-film electrode with Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> interlayer, the first cycle of CV curves of the electrode without Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> interlayer shows a current peak around 3.2 V, which is considered to come from the reaction between cathode and electrolyte. EIS measurements show that Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> interlayer can suppress the increase of interface resistant during charge and discharge, which means a more stable interface can be kept by interface modification. In order to make a more detailed observation of the interfacial structure, DR-XAS near edge structure of the electrodes are analyzed at Co K-edge. The energy shift around the interface in the electrodes with Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4 </jats:sub>interlayer is smaller than that of samples without Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4 </jats:sub>interlayer. These results indicate that valence changes of cobalt ions near cathode/solid electrolyte interface are suppressed by interface modification. The introducing of Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> interlayer reduces the inter-diffusion between cathode and solid electrolyte. The results of both electrochemical and DR-XAS measurements present that the reaction mechanism is the reaction product layer at cathode/electrolyte interface in all-solid-state battery using sulfide electrolyte. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Reference </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] K.

Cyclic voltammetry measurement (CV) was carried out from 3.2 V to 4.4 V at 0.1 mV/s. EIS measurement was performed at 3.9 V, 4.0 V, 4.1 V, 4.2 V, 4.3 V and 4.4 V with a 30 mV amplitude. The frequency range of EIS was limited from 10<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> to 10<jats:sup>6\u00a0</jats:sup>Hz. Depth-resolved XAS measurements were conducted using the BL37XU beamline, SPring-8, Japan, with a two-dimensional pixel array detector, PILATUS (Dectris, Switzerland). </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The first cycle of CV curves of the film without Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> interlayer shows a current peak around 3.2 V, which is considered to come from the reaction between cathode and electrolyte. EIS measurements show that the interfacial resistance of the films with Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> interlayer does not increase compared with the film without Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> interlayer. In order to discuss the interfacial structure, depth resolved X-ray near edge structure at Co K-edge is analyzed. The energy shift around the interface in the film with Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4 </jats:sub>interlayer is smaller than that of sample without Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4 </jats:sub>interlayer. These results indicate that valence changes of cobalt ions near cathode/solid electrolyte interface are suppressed by using Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> interlayer. The introducing of Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4\u00a0</jats:sub>interlayer reduces the inter-diffusion between cathode and solid electrolyte. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Reference </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] K.

The prevailing understanding is that LiNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> reacts with metallic lithium anode to form a passivation layer which suppresses redox shuttles of lithium polysulfides, enabling good rechargeability of Li-S batteries. However, this view is seeing more challenges in the recent studies, and above all, the inability of inhibiting polysulfide reduction on Li anode. A closely related issue is the progressive reduction of LiNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> on Li anode which elevates internal resistance of the cell and compromises its cycling stability. Herein, we systematically investigated the function of LiNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> in redox-shuttle suppression, and propose the suppression as a result of catalyzed oxidation of polysulfides to sulfur by nitrate anions on or in the proximity of the electrode surface upon cell charging. This hypothesis is supported by both density functional theory calculations and the nitrate anions-suppressed self-discharge rate in Li-S cells. The catalytic mechanism is further validated by the use of ruthenium oxide (RuO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, a good oxygen evolution catalyst) on cathode, which equips the LiNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-free cell with higher capacity and improved capacity retention over 400 cycles.</jats:p>"}

Among the suitable imaging methods for this task is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is a very powerful radiological diagnostic method. In this study, MR microscopy was used to image electroplating in a lithium symmetric cell, which was used as a model for a lithium metal battery. Lithium electrodeposition in this cell was studied by sequential 3D 1H MRI of 1M LiPF6 in EC/DMC electrolyte under different charging conditions, which resulted in different dynamics of the amount of electroplated lithium and its structure. The acquired images depicted the electrolyte distribution, so that the images of deposited lithium, that did not give a detectable signal, corresponded to the negatives of these images. With this indirect MRI, phenomena such as: the transition from a mossy to a dendritic structure at Sand\u2019s time, the growth of whiskers, the growth of dendrites with arborescent structure, the formation of dead lithium, and the formation of gas due to electrolyte decomposition were observed. In addition, the effect of charge and discharge cycles on electrodeposition was also studied. It was found that it is difficult to correctly predict the occurrence of these phenomena based on charging conditions alone, as seemingly identical conditions resulted in different results.</jats:p>"}

However, significant challenges, such as dendritic lithium deposition, low Coulombic efficiency (CE), and electrolyte instability, have limited their commercial viability. This study presents a novel solution in the form of an electrospun gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) membrane integrated with a copper (Cu) foil collector. This composite, termed Cu@GPE, offers a dual-functional approach, acting as both the electrolyte and an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI), aimed at mitigating lithium deposition irregularities and enhancing battery performance.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Cu@GPE membrane is fabricated through electrospinning, which yields a highly porous, mechanically robust fiber network composed of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP). The polymer matrix provides strong Li\u2013C\u2013F bonding, crucial for forming a stable ASEI, ensuring uniform lithium-ion flux, and minimizing dendritic growth. Furthermore, the strong electrostatic interaction between the Cu foil and the electrospun fiber sheet ensures enhanced lithium deposition uniformity, critical for preventing lithium dendrite formation, which leads to cell short-circuiting and capacity fade.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Extensive characterization confirms the beneficial impact of the Cu@GPE design. Cross-sectional Focused ion beam Scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) images demonstrate that lithium deposition on Cu@GPE remains densified, smooth and dendrite-free over extended cycling. Additionally, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis reveals the formation of a robust ASEI with strong Li\u2013C\u2013F bonds, while electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shows a significant reduction in interfacial resistance compared to conventional gel polymer electrolytes (cGPE). These findings indicate that the Cu@GPE membrane not only stabilizes the lithium-metal interface but also enhances lithium-ion transport efficiency.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Performance testing of the Cu@GPE in half-cell configurations (Cu@GPE|Li) showcases its superior electrochemical properties. At a high current density of 5 mA/cm\u00b2, the Cu@GPE|Li cell achieves an impressive 97.14% Coulombic efficiency (CE) after 200 cycles, compared to the cGPE counterpart, which reaches only 90.08% CE after 100 cycles. This substantial improvement highlights the stability and effectiveness of the Cu@GPE membrane in promoting uniform lithium deposition and suppressing dendrite formation, even under demanding operational conditions.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Moreover, the Cu@GPE was evaluated in a full-cell configuration using LiNi<jats:sub>0.33</jats:sub>Mn<jats:sub>0.33</jats:sub>Co<jats:sub>0.33</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (NMC) as the cathode material, resulting in a highly stable and efficient Cu@GPE|NMC AF-LMB. Compared to the conventional Cu|cGPE|NMC setup, the Cu@GPE|NMC configuration demonstrates enhanced cycling stability, capacity retention, and energy density, underscoring its potential for real-world applications. The improved electrochemical performance of the Cu@GPE is attributed to its dual functionality as both an electrolyte and ASEI, which maintains a stable and uniform lithium-metal interface throughout cycling.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Cu@GPE\u2019s success is primarily driven by its ability to form a stable PVDF-HFP-based ASEI. This ASEI layer significantly enhances the mechanical and chemical stability of the battery, reducing degradation pathways and preventing capacity loss associated with conventional electrolytes. By effectively addressing the key issues of dendritic growth and electrolyte instability, the Cu@GPE design paves the way for more reliable and safer AFLMBs.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Overall, the Cu@GPE presents a transformative advancement in the field of AF-LMBs by integrating electrolyte and ASEI functionalities into a single electrospun membrane. Through enhanced electrostatic interactions and robust Li\u2013C\u2013F bonding, the Cu@GPE achieves exceptional lithium deposition uniformity, high Coulombic efficiency, and prolonged cycling stability. This innovation offers a promising pathway toward safer, high-performance lithium metal batteries, with potential applications in electric vehicles, grid storage, and portable electronics. The study\u2019s findings emphasize the Cu@GPE\u2019s potential to overcome longstanding challenges in AF-LMB development, making it a critical component in the future of energy storage technologies.    </jats:p>"}

Recently, the interface thermal runaway issues between reactive Li\u2010metal and solid\u2010state electrolytes (SSEs) have attracted increasing attention, but it has been less studied.

Further, a highly safe ASS Li\u2010metal battery without external pressure package is reported by constructing a stable heterogeneous interface layer (HIL) consisting of ALD\u2010coated aluminum oxide and PECVD\u2010deposited amorphous silicon (a\u2010Si), which significantly reduces the interface exothermic reaction and suppresses the interface thermal runaway both theoretically and experimentally. The ASS Li\u2010metal symmetric battery shows a long cycling stability both at RT and high temperature over 150 \u00b0C being at least 8\u2010times higher than that of the one without HIL.

The solid/solid interface creates complex dynamic feedback loops: mechanical stress from anisotropic volume changes accelerates interfacial chemical reactions; chemical degradation progressively alters electrochemical behavior; and continuous electrochemical cycling induces further mechanical instability. This multiscale coupling manifests as progressive contact loss, microcracks, detrimental space charge layer, and impedance growth, which collectively compromise performance under demanding conditions. This review establishes a coherent mechanistic framework to understand these highly interdependent degradation pathways, and systematically evaluates various stabilization strategies, including targeted surface modification, strategic bulk engineering, and innovative synergistic design approaches that specifically address the inherently coupled interface instability. Despite progress, intrinsic material incompatibilities persist, necessitating breakthroughs in materials design, interface engineering, characterization, and manufacturing.

As graphite-based anodes approach their theoretical limits, lithium metal has emerged as a promising alternative due to its ultrahigh capacity (3,860 mAh g\u22121) and the lowest electrochemical potential (\u22123.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode).

This could cause a battery short circuit, resulting in safety hazards such as thermal runaway. In addition, the continuous rupture and repair of the SEIs during the repeated charge/discharge processes will constantly consume the active lithium, which leads to a significant decrease in battery capacity. An effective strategy to address these challenges is to design and construct ideal artificial SEIs on the surface of the lithium metal anode.

A low stack pressure is required for the commercialization of ASSLBs, and the key to reduce stack pressure is to regulate the volume variation of the components during charging/discharging. This study establishes a three-dimensional electrochemical\u2013mechanical coupled model to investigate the underlying mechanism of the volume variation of ASSLBs comprised of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode, Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte, and lithium metal anode, considering the electrochemical kinetics, Li diffusion, elastic\u2013plastic deformation, and their interplays. Results reveal that lithium plating at the lithium anode surface significantly increases the volumetric strain (&amp;gt;60%) and dominates the overall volume expansion of ASSLBs during charging. Increasing the thickness of the lithium metal anode is beneficial to accommodate the Li deposition through the deformation of soft lithium, reduce the expansion in the thickness direction, and lower the external pressure. The carbon black-binder domain (CBD) with a lower Young's modulus can be used as a buffer layer to adjust the volume change in the cathode domain, which can also effectively alleviate the mechanical stress to reduce possible damage. Increasing the volume fraction of NCM particles can induce a larger volumetric strain of the cathode, resulting in an increase in the expansion of ASSLBs. The developed multiphysics model reveals the underlying electrochemical\u2013mechanical coupled volume variation mechanism of the ASSLBs to provide guidance on the design and fabrication of next-generation ASSLBs under low pressure.</jats:p>"}

Creating multifunctional separators offers an effective and cost\u2010efficient solution for addressing fast charging and safety challenges in LMBs. This study proposes a method to prepare a functional separator by in situ growing a polydopamine copper chelate (PDA(Cu)) coating on a polypropylene (PP)/polyethylene (PE)/PP separator (PP/PE/PP@PDA(Cu)). The PDA(Cu) exhibits excellent electrolyte wetting properties and ion exclusion effects, contributing to high ionic conductivity (5.02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup>\u2074 S\u00a0cm<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>) and high lithium\u2010ion (Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>) transference number (0.776). Owing to its strong adhesion to the lithium metal anode, the coating significantly suppresses the formation of lithium dendrites. The Li||Li symmetric cell with a PP/PE/PP@PDA(Cu) separator demonstrates highly stable lithium plating\u2010stripping cycles, lasting over 900 h. Additionally, the PDA(Cu) promotes the formation of a stable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) film on the LiFePO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> cathode surface. The LiFePO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>||Li cell with a PP/PE/PP@PDA(Cu) separator maintains 85.1% of its capacity after 6000 cycles at 10 C.

However, their practical application has been hindered by the challenge of simultaneously achieving ultrathin thickness and high Coulombic efficiencies during lithium deposition and stripping. To address this issue, we propose a phosphorization strategy involving the phosphorization of garnet-based solid electrolyte and subsequently the reaction with molten lithium. This lithium-phosphorus reaction markedly enhances the wettability of molten lithium on a copper current collector, enabling the fabrication of a sub-10-\u00b5m-thick ultrathin lithium metal anode. As a proof of concept, a 6-\u00b5m-thick ultrathin lithium metal anode demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a Coulombic efficiency of over 98.8% at a substantial utilization rate of 83%.

However, increasing electrode thickness introduces challenges, including elevated resistance and mechanical issues such as cracking and flaking, particularly in slurry\u2010based wet processes. This highlights the necessity for solvent\u2010free, low\u2010resistance thick cathode fabrication methods. In this study, the impact of a solvent\u2010free mechano\u2013thermal fabrication process on the electrochemical performance of high\u2010nickel ternary metal oxide\u2010based thick cathodes is explored. A key challenge identified is the formation of solvophobic crystalline structures on the surface of the active cathode materials. To address this, a fast cooling strategy is implemented at the end of the solvent\u2010free fabrication process, which successfully reduced the solvophobic crystallinity, ultimately surpassing the electrochemical performance of cathodes produced through wet processes. Furthermore, incorporating a PVDF/succinonitrile (SN) mixture binder via liquid\u2010phase mixing further minimized crystallinity, resulting in significantly improved electrolyte wettability, ionic conductivity, and mechanical adhesion.

Currently, extrusion followed by lamination is the main process used to produce lithium metal foil of at least a dozen of micrometers thick. To further reduce this thickness, we have chosen to use a vacuum evaporation process (PVD), which allows for thickness control on the order of a few hundred nanometers. Lithium films ranging from 5 to 20 \u00b5m can be produced using an argon glovebox connected to a vacuum deposition chamber, thereby preventing contact with air. Through various tests, we report on the main governing deposition parameters (e.g., substrate, evaporation temperature) that significantly influence the final film microstructure, which in turn impact the Coulombic efficiency of the corresponding electrochemical cell. As an example, the <jats:bold>Figure </jats:bold>(<jats:italic>SEM pictures of lithium obtained by PVD with a) low speed deposition rate and b) high speed deposition rate</jats:italic>) shows SEM images of lithium film microstructures obtained with different deposition parameter speed but with similar thickness.

These performances are compared and assessed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, linear galvanodynamic, and lithium plating/stripping routines.

Leveraging domain knowledge informed machine learning and a 4-year dataset of over 18\u00a0000 cycles and 12 million data points, from cells cycled to failure, we uncovered a correlation between initial lithium plating/stripping behavior and subsequent anode changes, enabling the identification of early indicators for distinct failure types. Our model accurately predicts failure types using only the first two cycles, less than 2% of the data, demonstrating the effectiveness of initial curve features as electrochemical fingerprints. Key electrochemical fingerprints describing lithium microstructure and its interphase with the electrolyte are validated to be critical to kinetics and reversibility degradation. Specifically, the fingerprints influence the formation of ineffective interphase regions (lacking intimate contact with the lithium metal) and inactive lithium, which in turn lengthen charge carrier (lithium-ion and electron) transport paths, leading to poorer kinetics and reversibility. The fingerprints and model generalize well across typical published electrolyte systems with low misidentification, demonstrating versatility and practicality.

[1-2] A major strategy to drive the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is by enhancing the energy density of lithium batteries, which directly extends the driving range per charge. [3-4] Lithium metal batteries (LMBs), with their lithium metal anodes providing low electrochemical potential and high specific capacity, hold great promise as next-generation EV batteries due to their significantly higher energy density. [5-6] However, the current carbonate-based electrolytes used in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are not compatible with lithium metal anodes, resulting in rapid capacity loss and serious safety hazards, particularly from lithium dendrite formation.

Among the various dicarbonyl solvents investigated, dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC) stands out as the most promising candidate. Interestingly, despite its structural resemblance to monocarbonyl solvents, DMDC shows stronger solvent coordination at the same lithium-to-carbonyl ratio. This results in the formation of a more stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and enhances the electrolyte's anodic stability. In most electrolyte systems, solvation energy is primarily driven by enthalpy, but DMDC's bidentate structure introduces a significant role for entropy, as Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>-DMDC complexes release fewer free molecules. When paired with the non-solvating co-solvent TTE, which reduces the electrolyte\u2019s viscosity, the DMDC-TTE system provides highly stable cycling of the lithium anode by modulating solvation entropy.

Dendrite initiation and propagation in specific solid state electrolyte materials has been explained, at a microscopic scale, as emerging from the lithium-filling of pores within the solid state electrolytes via microcracks. At the atomistic scale, the thermodynamic instability of many solid state electrolyte materials can explain their susceptibility to crystal decomposition upon contact with the lithium anode. However, for a more complete picture of the dendrite formation mechanisms, an understanding of the dendrite initiation mechanism at the intermediate nanoscopic scale is required. This work applies a machine learning potential (DIEP) for simulating six different solid state electrolyte-lithium interfaces at 300 K and 1000 K, with model sizes ranging from 24k to 36k atoms, for durations exceeding 20 ps. Our simulations show that the lithium dendrite initiation process can have an underpinning nanoscopic mechanism, in which the crystal decomposition by direct lithium interaction leads to the clustering of lithium. The simulations also suggest a possible mechanism for the creation of voids within the solid-electrolyte interphase, which have been observed in the Li$|$Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl$|$Li interface.</jats:p>"}

Currently, intercalation-based cathode materials, such as lithium-layered oxide cathodes composed of nickel, cobalt, and manganese, dominate the market. However, these materials face significant limitations, including restricted capacity and the high cost of nickel and cobalt, making it challenging to meet the growing demand for higher energy density and lower costs. To address these challenges, iron(II) fluoride (FeF<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) has emerged as a promising alternative. FeF<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is a conversion-based cathode material capable of achieving a high theoretical capacity of 571 mAh/g through multi-electron reactions. Its high operating voltage of 2.66 V, facilitated by the high electronegativity of fluorine, enables an impressive energy density of 1519 Wh/kg. Moreover, the use of iron, a cheap and abundant resource, instead of costly nickel and cobalt, provides significant cost advantages. However, the practical application of FeF<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> faces several challenges. First, the synthesis of FeF<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is difficult. Fluorine exhibits high volatility at elevated temperatures, which can lead to impurity formation. Consequently, applying commercial solid-state synthesis methods, which require high temperatures for short durations, is challenging. Meanwhile, the low electronic and ionic conductivity of FeF<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> has prompted researchers to focus on developing nano-sized particles to enhance reactivity. Yet, this approach has drawbacks, such as decreased packing density, which reduces overall battery energy density. Therefore, developing methods to achieve reversible reactions in FeF<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> at the large particle size is essential for its adoption as a high energy density cathode material.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this study, micron-size FeF<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was successfully synthesized via a solid-state reaction method. The material features a unique surface morphology and a porous internal structure, resulting in high reactivity while maintaining large particle sizes. This design enables the achievement of the theoretical capacity of 571 mAh/g. Additionally, an analysis of capacity fading during initial cycles identified delamination from the current collector as the primary cause. To address this issue, carbon-coated aluminum current collectors were employed, significantly improving stability during early cycles. Furthermore, the dissolution of iron from FeF<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was observed, leading to the loss of active material and the deposition of dissolved species on the lithium metal surface, which degraded battery performance. To mitigate this, a localized high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE) was used. The electrolyte promoted the formation of stable cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. These layers effectively suppressed iron dissolution and improved the stability of the lithium metal anode. As a result, the battery demonstrated excellent cycle life stability over 300 cycles. This study represents the first demonstration of the practical potential of micro-size FeF<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> particles as cathode materials, overcoming the limitations of conventional nanoscale approaches. By providing critical insights into the design and development of FeF<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and other conversion-based metal fluoride cathodes, this work not only paves the way for realizing high energy density cathode materials but also highlights the feasibility of adopting conversion-based technologies in commercial lithium-ion batteries. These advancements hold the potential to accelerate the practical deployment of such technologies in electric vehicles and beyond, driving progress toward a sustainable energy future.    </jats:p>"}

Among the various synthesis methods, atmospheric-pressure microwave plasma technology stands out as an innovative approach that is gradually gaining prominence in the scientific and technological fields.While none of the traditional methods offers a single-step, low-cost approach for obtaining high-quality graphene powder, plasma technology represents a significant advance.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>More concretely, microwave plasma torches (Fig. 1) exhibit high reactivity, being capable of inducing decomposition reactions with a high efficiency (~100%), surpassing traditional chemical processes. Organic molecules are broken into atomic components, leading to the formation of compounds different from the original ones when the atoms recombine at the plasma outlet. At atmospheric pressure, the numerous collisions between electrons and heavy particles favor the nucleation process of materials, such as graphene, by injecting carbon precursors. It is an eco-friendly, cost-effective and scalable method for high-quality graphene generation in a single-step process.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The generation of graphene through ethanol decomposition in a particular type of torch, the TIAGO torch (Torche \u00e0 Injection Axiale sur Guide d\u2019Ondes), device designed by Prof. Michel Moisan, has been extensively studied [3-6]. Throughout these studies, the synthesis process of graphene using atmospheric-pressure plasma technology has been gradually optimized, reaching production rates of 140 mg/h in the most recent research [6]. There, nitrogen adsorption/desorption tests as well as pore size distribution measurements of graphene were carried out (Fig. 2). In this characterization, isotherm curves show a type IV behavior, related to mesoporous materials, and a similar pore size distribution. Their porosity fits a bi-modal distribution, with a first zone of small mesoporosity (3-18 nm), and a second zone with large mesopores and some macropores (30-70 nm). The absence of microporosity is confirmed by t-plot method.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Moreover, graphene synthesized through microwave plasma technology is found to be of particular interest for applications in the energy storage field, specifically in the design of high-performance Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) batteries. During discharge, the lithium metal anode undergoes oxidation, releasing lithium ions and electrons that migrate to the sulfur cathode. However, during the electrochemical reactions at the positive electrode, the cyclic sulfur molecule (S<jats:sub>8</jats:sub>) is reduced, leading to the formation of a series of polysulfides (Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>n</jats:sub>), some of them in solution. Here lies one of the main drawbacks of these batteries: the shuttle effect, which involves the migration of polysulfides during charge and discharge cycles. This causes the formation of polysulfide deposits on the lithium electrode, which results in a loss of battery capacity and faster degradation of performance over time, diminishing energy efficiency and reducing lifespan. However, the porosity properties of graphene can fight the shuttle effect, capturing polysulfides in solution as shown in Fig. 3. The first picture depicts the dissolution of Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> polysulfide in a dioxolane (DOL) and dimethoxyethane (DME) mixture to mimic the electrolyte environment used in batteries. The yellow color characteristic of high-order polysulfides is clearly visible. In the subsequent image, graphene powder is incorporated. After two hours, it is observed that the solution has become colorless, indicating the adsorption of these polysulfides by the graphene matrix. Recently, the integration of ethanol-derived graphene obtained through plasma technology in sulfur-graphene composites acting as a highly-efficient positive electrode has been proven to be a suitable strategy for the design of Li-S batteries, (Fig. 3) with ultralong cycle life [2].</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] F.J.

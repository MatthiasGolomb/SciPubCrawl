As compared with the conventional graphite anode of LIBs, lithium anode has a high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mA h g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) and a low electrochemical potential (-3.04 V vs SHE). Nonetheless, no stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) forms on the surface of lithium metal. The continuous electrolyte consumption along with the non-uniform lithium deposition leads to the limited cell lifespan and cell safety concern, both of which impede their LMBs practical applications. To address the problems, herein, we introduce an alloying protective layer on lithium metal anode integrating with thin Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> layer modified on LiNi<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>\n                  <jats:sub>.8</jats:sub>Co<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>\n                  <jats:sub>.1</jats:sub>Mn<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>\n                  <jats:sub>.1</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (NMC811) cathode to prolong lifespan of batteries. By using the lithium alloy protective layer, the LMB exhibits good stability performance better than the fresh Li metal approximately 20%.

The commercial separators such as polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene (PE) prepared by a wet or dry processes, however, allow the generation of plentiful porosities, resulting in the uneven Li ion stripping/platting and finally the formation of Li dendrites. Thence, we construct an atomic interlamellar ion channel by introducing the layered montmorillonite (MMT) on the surface of separator to guide the Li ion flux and achieve the stable Li deposition. The atomic interlamellar ion channel with a spacing of 1.4 nm has strong absorption capacity to the electrolyte and reserve capacity for the Li ions, thus promoting rapidly transfer of Li ions and making an even deposition of Li ions at the anode. As a result, when assembled with the proposed separator, the Coulombic efficiency (CE) of Li||Cu batteries archives 98.2 % after 200 cycles and the Li||Li symmetric batteries actualize their stable platting/stripping even after 800 h. Importantly, the proposed separator allows 140 % specific capacity increase after 190 cycles as employing the Li-S batteries.</jats:p>"}

The high capacity (1675 mAh/g) and low cost (~0.1 $/kg) of sulfur make Li-S batteries an ideal candidate to fill this need. However, sulfur has poor electrical conductivity and Li-S batteries are prone to polysulfide shuttling that decreases the battery life. In an effort to address these problems, we are developing a highly-scalable mediated Li-S flow battery using a lithium metal anode, solid state Li ion conductor separator, sulfur cathode, and a redox mediator. During discharge, the Li metal is oxidized to Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> and the redox mediator (RM) is reduced. The RM will then react with the S returning to its oxidized form and enabling the formation of Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S without the need for electrical contact between the S and counter electrode. The oxidized RM is then reduced again, and the process is repeated until all available S has reacted. A second RM with a potential lower than that of the Li-S reaction is used to enable the charge process. Two such mediators are decamethylferrocene (2.86 V vs Li/Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>) and cobaltocene (2.06 V vs. Li/Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>), Figure 1. The flow battery design has multiple benefits. First, the use of a solid state Li ion conductor mitigates polysulfide shuttling, thereby increasing the cycle life. Second, the issue of sulfur conductivity is addressed through use of the redox mediator, where the mediator can easily diffuse through the electrolyte reaching the sulfur and eliminating the need for excess conductive carbon additives. Third, the flow battery design enables physical separation of the anode and cathode, mitigating the potential for short circuiting and thermal runaway even if the Li does puncture the solid state electrolyte. Using this cell design, we examine the role of the solvent, anion, and polysulfide concentration on Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> transport across the solid electrolyte interphase as well as the role of the mediation potential and interactions between the polysulfide and mediator.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-mission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC., a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International, Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"224fig1.jpg\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>"}

The concept was confirmed by computer simulation of current distribution in finite element analysis, showing uniform current distribution with the AMA, instead of high surface current density with regular 3D electrodes without the SEI. The designed anode has been prepared and evaluated in coin cells. Symmetrical cells with AMAs have completed 500 plating cycles at 8 mA/cm2 and 4 mAh/cm2 without shorting. LFP coin full cells with AMAs have shown 300 cycles with over 90% capacity retention.

Here, the ultrathin bilayer of graphite and SiO2 is deposited on Li foil (Graphite.SiO2@Li) using Radio Frequency (R-F) sputtering to address the inherent problem of lithium metal anode. The R-F sputtered electrodes can be cycled for more than 1300 h and 550 h at a current density of 0.5 mA cm-2 and 1 mA cm-2 respectively to reach a capacity of 1 mAh cm-2.

Higher capacity at higher rates and long stable cycling performances with low voltage hysteresis was achieved with the use of graphite.SiO2@Li anode. The graphite layer lowers the impedance, buffers the volume expansion issue, and helps to electrically connect the plated Li with the bulk Li electrode underneath. The higher electrolyte wettability of SiO2 provides much better Li-ion transportation, and ultrathin SiO2 film allows fast Li-ion diffusion and lithiation/delithiation to slow down the growth of Li dendrites.

Polymer coatings on lithium metal surface have been proven to be an effective protection method in terms of improved morphology, higher coulombic efficiency, and a longer cycle life. However, there is a variety of design principles of polymer coatings proposed by the research community, and the influence of polymer swelling in liquid electrolytes remains poorly understood. Herein we use crosslinking density and solvent\u2013polymer interaction to quantitatively explain the mechanical property and the ion-transport property of polymer coatings when swollen in liquid electrolytes. Low crosslinking density is beneficial for reducing the rigidity and enhancing the viscosity of the polymer. Ion conductivity increases with the swelling ratio, and activation energy of lithium-ion transport increases in a polar polymer with strong ion\u2013polymer coupling. We propose that polymer coatings must be combined with the emerging electrolytes with unconventional solvent compositions to realize a practical high-performance lithium metal battery. This study can provide design guidelines for polymer coatings through the optimized interactions with upcoming high-performance electrolytes.</jats:p>"}

Lithium metal is indeed an ideal anode for lithium batteries due to its high specific capacity (3860 mAh g<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>). However, the growth of dendrites under high charge currents restricts the use of lithium anode in rechargeable batteries until solid electrolytes that can mechanically hamper dendrite growth can be developed. Efforts are currently dedicated to solving these problems by focusing on either improving the shear modulus of the electrolyte, or on the modification of the lithium-electrolyte interface. The electrochemical stability of novel solid electrolytes towards lithium is commonly determined by galvanostatic cycling of Li-Li symmetric cells. However, important characteristics of the lithium foil used in most studies are seldom provided, hence making comparisons between materials trivial. This paper demonstrates the importance of a thorough electrode characterization for the cycling of symmetric cells. In this study, two types of lithium foils are used with polyethylene oxide-based (PEO-based) electrolyte. A detailed characterization of the morphological and physico-chemical properties of the metallic electrodes is first performed by PeakForce Tunneling Atomic force microscopy (PeakForce-TUNA\u2122), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), followed by an evaluation of the interface with PEO-based electrolyte. It is demonstrated that lithium foil morphology is a key factor in the electrochemical performance of the cell and a novel electrochemical pre-treatment program is presented. This type of pre-treatment, still unreported in the existing literature, results in a longer life for lithium symmetrical cells.</jats:p>"}

We introduced the TGC (titration gas chromatography) method to quantify the corrosion rate of electrochemically deposited Li in liquid electrolyte system. It is demonstrated that lithium metal is mainly suffered from chemical corrosion by the liquid electrolyte instead of by electrochemical corrosion, that is, the direct charge transfer between lithium-electrolyte interphase. Besides, the corrosion rate of electrochemically deposited lithium in different electrolytes is further studied, where different electrolytes are found to introduce different corrosion rates. By taking into account the influence of different electrolytes on the SEI and Lithium morphology, we differentiate these two aspects, and the results in (1) The corrosion rate is mainly affected by the surface area of deposited lithium. The larger the surface area that the lithium has, the faster the corrosion rate will be; (2) The SEI components formed by different electrolytes on deposited lithium are similar, and different electrolytes will lead to the similar corrosion rate when the surface area is the same.

Its exceptional cycle life and low cost will make the technology a promising choice for electric vehicle applications. In this talk, we will review several interrelated efforts to realize this goal: 1) searching for SPAN-like materials with higher S loading and higher capacities by tuning N:C:S ratios with different polymer and sulfur precursors; 2) improving the packing density of SPAN particles in the cathode by controlling particle shape and size using new synthesis approaches. A highlight is a um-sized, platelet-like morphology that greatly increase packing densities; 3) developing a solvent-free homogenous chemical lithiation method for the synthesis of lithium containing SPAN. The lithiated SPAN can greatly reduce the irreversible capacity loss during the first discharge cycle and minimize the volume change associated with the initial lithiation process; and 4) continuing the development of new electrolyte compositions that can further improve the lithium metal anode efficiency without sacrificing SPAN cycle life. These studies hold the promise to enable a practical, low-cost and long-life Li/S battery.     </jats:p>"}

The chemistry of the dynamically evolving solid\u2010electrolyte interphase layer on the lithium surface is critical to achieving reversible plating and stripping of lithium. Herein, electrolyte formulations are carefully varied and employed to modulate the composition, and thereby, the properties of the lithium\u2010electrolyte interface. The impact of these changes in the interfacial chemistry on the dynamics of lithium deposition is evaluated by tracking cyclability in an anode\u2010free full cell configuration. Critical insights are revealed on the role of different components of the electrolyte and their interplay, including various functional groups in the electrolyte salt, oxidizing effect of lithium nitrate, and the intrinsically stabilizing effect of polysulfide species, in determining the characteristics of lithium deposition and lithium cycling efficiency. The study illuminates the key elements underlying the unique chemistry of the lithium\u2013electrolyte interface in Li\u2013S batteries and it can spur further development of novel strategies toward stabilizing the lithium\u2010metal anode in the Li\u2013S system.</jats:p>"}

The high capacity (1675 mAh/g) and low cost (~0.1 $/kg) of sulfur make Li-S batteries an ideal candidate to fill this need. However, sulfur has poor electrical conductivity and Li-S batteries are prone to polysulfide shuttling that decreases the battery life. In an effort to address these problems, we are developing a highly-scalable mediated Li-S flow battery using a lithium metal anode, solid state Li ion conductor separator, sulfur cathode, and a redox mediator. During discharge, the Li metal is oxidized to Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> and the redox mediator (RM) is reduced. The RM will then react with the S returning to its oxidized form and enabling the formation of Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S without the need for electrical contact between the S and counter electrode. The oxidized RM is then reduced again, and the process is repeated until all available S has reacted. A second RM with a potential lower than that of the Li-S reaction is used to enable the charge process. Two such mediators are decamethylferrocene (2.86 V vs Li/Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>) and cobaltocene (2.06 V vs. Li/Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>), Figure 1. The flow battery design has multiple benefits. First, the use of a solid state Li ion conductor mitigates polysulfide shuttling, thereby increasing the cycle life. Second, the issue of sulfur conductivity is addressed through use of the redox mediator, where the mediator can easily diffuse through the electrolyte reaching the sulfur and eliminating the need for excess conductive carbon additives. Third, the flow battery design enables physical separation of the anode and cathode, mitigating the potential for short circuiting and thermal runaway even if the Li does puncture the solid state electrolyte. Using this cell design, we examine the role of the solvent, anion, and polysulfide concentration on Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> transport across the solid electrolyte interphase as well as the role of the mediation potential and interactions between the polysulfide and mediator.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-mission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC., a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International, Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"225fig1.jpg\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>"}

This has triggered a huge supply-demand scenario for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) around the globe. Currently, LIBs rely heavily on cathodes such as LiNi<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>Mn<jats:sub>y</jats:sub>Co<jats:sub>z</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, LiFePO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, LiNiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, LiCoO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, to maintain their place to meet energy expectations. Rarely, lithium-free compounds have been used as positive electrodes due to the irreversibility of redox reactions and the requirement of lithium metal anode. These have restricted the further development of new cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Some of the materials are Cr<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, ZnO, TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, MnO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, and V<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>5</jats:sub>. These materials have high theoretical capacities, however, except V<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>5</jats:sub>, other materials have a low potential for insertion/extraction of Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ions and can possibly be reduced to the metal state during intercalation reactions. To ensure practicality and feasibility of such materials, it is important to focus on the lithiation strategies, viz., lithium additives, pre-lithiation of the anode,film-forming additives, and blended cathodes. However, these approaches cause cell voltage modification due to the presence of Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ion voids in the electrode. Fortunately, the pre-lithiation of the anode compensates for the initial loss of lithium ions in the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI). However, the pre-lithiation technique is complex and uneconomical, resulting in it being infeasible in the commercial applications.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Here we report, in situ lithiation of the electrodes for the advancement of the lithium-free cathode research using lithium-electrode as a reservoir.

Here, V<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>5</jats:sub> cathode with meso carbon microbeads (MCMB) was used to fabricate high specific capacity and high energy-density reserved lithium-ion batteries (RLIBs). The RLIB system delivered a high charge specific capacity of 245 mAh g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> following two Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ions insertion/extraction. The tri-electrode system provided an initial high energy density of 980 Wh kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>.

There is a stark resemblance in the performance of RLIB performance with half-cell profile and in terms of capacity versus cycle number. Multiple module calorimetry provided the thermal heat signature to elucidate the safety features of the proposed RLIB system and compare it to the existing LIBs.

They find use in portable electronics, electric vehicles and also grid storage. The conventional Li-ion battery technology employs electrolytes that have flammable organic solvents as key constituents. In addition, these electrolytes are thermodynamically unstable at voltages beyond 4 V; stability at voltages beyond 4 V is essential for the development of high voltage and therefore, high energy density Li-ion batteries. Moreover, state-of-the-art lithium ion batteries use a graphitic anode, which has a low theoretical specific capacity of 372 mAh/g. Due to this low specific capacity, conventional LIBs are limited in scope with respect to their energy and power density. Lithium metal anodes with a theoretical specific capacity of 3860 mAh/g are ideal for the development of high energy density Li-ion batteries.

Data from operando 19F solution NMR indicates that both bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI\u2013) salt and bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)ether (BTFE) diluent molecules play a key role in solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, in contrast to prior reports that suggest diluents are inert. Using a combination of solution 17O NMR and cyclic voltammetry (CV), we assess differences in solvation and electrochemical reduction in LHCEs and compare to low concentration electrolytes (LCEs). We find that BTFE diluents are chemically (rather than electrochemically) reduced during Li metal battery operation, which can be detected with operando NMR, but not conventional electrochemical methods. Solid-state NMR (SSNMR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements confirm that LHCEs decompose to form a SEI on Li metal that contains organic BTFE reduction products as well as high quantities of lithium fluoride from both BTFE and FSI\u2013 reduction. Insight into the (electro)chemical reduction mechanisms underpinning SEI formation in LHCEs suggests that fluorinated ethers exhibit tunable reactivity that can be leveraged to control Li deposition behavior.</jats:p>"}

[1] Lithium metal battery (LMB) is considered as a promising energy storage system because of the exceptionally low electrochemical potential and ultrahigh specific capacity of the lithium metal anode. [2-4] Yet, the extensive application of LMBs is still obstructed by the extreme reactivity of lithium metal, which leads to severe safety problems. [5-6] To tackle this issue, the re-design of the electrolyte is viewed as the most practical approach due to its cost effectiveness. [7-8]</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this presentation, we successfully establish a solvation rule for the SEI enabler to achieve stable cycling of the lithium metal anode through a variety of electrochemical and solvation studies such as a Li/Cu cell test and IR-DOSY analysis. Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) was used as the exemplary solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) enabler because it is the most common SEI enabler in the LMB electrolyte, and it is able to form a desirable SEI on the lithium metal surface. The results of all electrochemical studies point to the existence of a critical ratio between FEC and a co-solvent (<jats:italic>e.g</jats:italic>., DMC, EMC, and EA) for the stable cycling of LMBs. If the FEC/co-solvent ratio is lower than the critical ratio, not only will an unstable SEI be formed, but the SEI will also be gradually deteriorated by the significant decomposition of lithium complexes, with Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> solvated solely by the co-solvent/non-SEI enabler. We discovered that the solvation number of FEC must be \u2265 1 to ensure the formation of a stable SEI, which mainly resulted from the sacrificial reduction of the SEI enabler and subsequent repair of the SEI to facilitate stable cycling of LMBs. This finding is crucial for the future development of functional electrolytes in that the ratio of FEC to co-solvent must exceed the critical volume/molar ratio for the solvation number of FEC to be \u2265 1.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Reference: <jats:list list-type=\"roman-lower\">\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>Schmuch, R.; Wagner, R.; H\u00f6rpel, G.; Placke, T.; Winter, M., <jats:italic>Nature Energy</jats:italic> \n                           <jats:bold>2018</jats:bold>, <jats:italic>3</jats:italic>, 267\u2013278.</jats:p>\n                     </jats:list-item>\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>Li, X.; Zheng, J.; Engelhard, M.

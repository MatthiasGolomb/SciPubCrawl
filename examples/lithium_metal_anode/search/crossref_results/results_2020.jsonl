Electric vehicle (EV) with longer cruising range is desired to enhance the utilization of renewable energies in transportation. In order to develop the EV with longer cruising range, it is important to improve the energy density of rechargeable batteries due to the limited space in EV. All solid state battery (ASSB) is expected to realize higher energy density compared to conventional lithium-ion battery because it is able to use a higher voltage cathode and/or lithium metal anode. Hence, ASSB is promising as a power source of the next-generation EV.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> In order to maximize the energy density of ASSB, active material with a higher capacity is necessary. This instigates the research toward the application of lithium metal anode, which possesses the highest theoretical capacity among anode materials. The key point for realizing lithium metal anode is to secure a good contact between lithium metal anode and solid electrolyte, since the decrease of reaction area would result in the increase of interfacial resistance and the decrease of power output. In other words, lithium metal deposition and dissolution should play important roles on the cell performance through the morphological changes of lithium metal at the interface. Previous research suggested that lithium metal dissolution causes deterioration in the contact<jats:sup> [1][2]</jats:sup>. On the other hand, the behavior of deposition has not been revealed. In this study, we try to understand the effect of lithium metal morphological behavior during deposition on the cell performance.

However, it is difficult to distinguish void from lithium metal due to the similarity of absorption coefficients between lithium metal and argon used as inert gas. Therefore, in this study, high pressure xenon method is developed. In this method, the X-ray imaging jig (and the void in the cell) is filled with high pressure xenon (8 atm) that has significant difference in absorption coefficient compared to lithium metal, making enough contrast to distinguish lithium metal from void. By using this high pressure xenon method, the distribution of SE, lithium metal, and void (xenon) is successfully visualized.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> In this study, a cylindrical symmetry cell (lithium metal/SE (LPS-glass)/lithium metal, diameter of 2 mm) is used.

In order to induce lithium dissolution/deposition, constant current of 0.2 mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> for 15 hours is supplied to the cell. Before and after the current supply, three dimensional images of the cell are captured by using X-ray CT.

Before the current supply, good contact condition is achieved between the SE and lithium metal. However, after current is applied, the contact remains only around the center of the cell. Figure 2 shows the trend of the cell voltage when current is applied. Meanwhile, the voltage gradually increases.

Conventional lithium ion batteries (LIBs) based on Li-ion intercalation, which have been widely applied, could not satisfy the demand for higher energy density and greater driving range of EVs. Elemental sulfur, an inexpensive, abundantly available, and environmental-friendly material, has become one of the most promising positive electrode active materials because of its high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>). Nevertheless, the commercialization of the rechargeable Li-S battery is still hindered by several main issues: the electronically insulating nature of sulfur and its discharge products (Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S/Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>), the large volumetric expansion of 80% upon its full lithiation, the dissolution and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide (LiPS).<jats:sup>[1-4]</jats:sup>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To achieve the practical application of Li-S battery, high energy density and stable cycling performance both need to be focused on. However, for the traditional ether-based electrolyte of 1,3\u2013dioxolane (DOL), and dimethoxyethane (DME) as solvent that is commonly utilized for Li-S battery, severe dissolution of sulfur species from cathode and shuttle effect of LiPS causes a loss of active material and poor cycling stability. To realize the high energy density of Li-S battery, the amounts of electrolyte in the whole battery system need to be controlled. Unfortunately, it is difficult to reduce the electrolyte/sulfur ratio (E/S [mL electrolyte/mg sulfur]) when using the conventional DOL/DME electrolyte because the electrodeposition of the LiPS was found to be significantly slower at high LiPS concentration for a given deposition substrate.<jats:sup>[5]</jats:sup> Therefore, development of novel electrolytes is of great importance to establishing high energy density Li-S batteries. Here, we report electrochemical performance of Li-S battery using the LiPS sparingly solvating electrolytes.<jats:sup>[6-8] </jats:sup>Based on these electrolytes, several advantages have been revealed. Firstly, the solubility of LiPS was greatly suppressed, and thus stable charge-discharge with high Coulombic efficiency was achieved in the Li-S batteries. Second, by utilizing pouch cell, we have achieved a high energy density (&gt; 300 Wh kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) for Li-S battery under an extremely low E/S ratio of 3.0 \u03bcL mg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>. Third, gassing behavior of the Li-S battery using the DOL/DME electrolyte, which indicates high safety risk, could also be obviously depressed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To further improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries based on LiPS sparingly solvating electrolytes with extremely low E/S ratios, we also explored sulfur electrode additives to improve the electrolyte wettability, various electrolyte additives to protect the lithium anode, and optimized making process for pouch cell.

Notable high energy next generation cathodes such as sulfur have their own issues with a liquid electrolyte based system, where the polysulfides discharge product dissolve into the electrolyte causing both: a loss of cathode active material and an unwanted shuttling of the polysulfides over the polymer separator to the lithium anode limiting their practical use. Moreover, the formation of lithium dendrites in lithium batteries is yet another challenging issue that not only limits battery cycle-life but also poses safety risks. The use of SEs can potentially address most of the issues related to next generation lithium batteries such as Li-S batteries, but getting rid of dendrite issues may not be addressed completely. One way to eliminate the dendrite issue is to use molten lithium as an anode.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has an ambitious plan to explore one of the most challenging planets in our solar system: Venus. The surface temperature of Venus can reach as high as 465\u00b0C and at same time, the Venus atmosphere is filled with corrosive gases such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, etc. A battery for such a challenging space mission can be built only if battery components (especially the electrolyte) is stable beyond 500\u00b0C and must be stable with molten lithium and sulfur electrodes for at least hours or days if not months\u2014longer is better.

Those mixtures were heated at a predetermined temperature of 800 to 900 \u2103 for 1h under Ar atmosphere in a silica tube for alkaline activation of AZA-800. The AZC-S composite was prepared by mixing various AZC with S, and then applying heat treatment: 155\u00b0C for 5 h, then 300\u00b0C for 2 h. The AZC-S composite cathode was prepared by mixing the AZC-S composite, acetylene black, carboxymethyl cellulose, and styrene-butadiene rubber at a respective weight ratio of 89:5:3:3.

When K<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>CO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> was used as an activator, the proportion of micropores tended to be higher than that with KOH. AZC-K<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>CO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> can confine up to 70 wt.% sulfur, which is ca.10 wt.% higher than the previous AZC-KOH. Figure 2 shows the results of constant current charge and discharge tests of the cathode prepared using AZC-KOH and AZC-K<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>CO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> with sulfur composites. AZC-K<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>CO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> has a lower capacity decay rate with charge / discharge cycles than AZC-KOH, which may be due to a large proportion of micropores that suppresses the elution of lithium polysulfides.

The high surface area of the interconnected conductive framework can homogenize the Li-ion flux distribution, lower the effective current density, and provides sufficient space for Li accommodation. However, the poor lithiophilicity of the micro/nanostructure host cannot govern the initial lithium nucleation, which leads to the non-uniform/dendritic Li deposition and unstable SEI formation. As a result, the nucleation overpotential and voltage hysteresis increases, which eventually leads to poor battery cycling performance. Thus, it is imperative to decorate a micro/nanostructured Li host with lithiophilic coatings or seeds for serving as a homogeneous nucleation site to guide the uniform lithium deposition. In this review, we summarize research progress on porous metal and non-metal based lithiophilic micro/nanostructured Li hosts. We present the synthesis, structural properties, and the significance of lithiophilic decorated micro/nanostructured Li host in the LMBs. Finally, the perspectives and critical challenges needed to address for the further improvement of LMBs are concluded.</jats:p>"}

Despite its ideal characteristics, Li metal anode(LMA) has a critical drawback that Li deposits grow in the form of dendrite due to its ununiform plating/stripping behaviors. The undesired dendritic growth of Li results in the detrimental effects on the cell performance, such as cell short-circuit, low coulombic efficiency(CE), and dead lithium, which have hampered widespread exploits of lithium metal-based batteries. Therefore, in recent years, numerous strategies to prevent or mitigate the problematic dendrite growth, including construction of artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), lithiophilicity/morphology control of current collector, modification of electrolyte, and so forth [1,2].</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Meanwhile, by virtue of quite successful improvement in performance of LMAs, the battery system using in-situ formed LMAs, called anode-free lithium metal batteries (AFLMBs) have gained much interests [3]. In AFLMBs, the anode compartment has only a current collector at the initial state and then lithium metal anode is formed by electroplating with lithium ions provided from the cathode through initial charging step. The absence of corrosive/reactive Li metal in assembly process decreases the production cost and the energy density of a full-cell can be increased due to additional loading of cathode active materials. However, the dendritic growth of lithium could become more problematic because the cyclable lithium ions are fully limited to those provided from the cathode active materials. For solving notorious dendrite problem in AFLMBs, many strategies such as a use of highly concentrated salt electrolytes [3], the addition of functional electrolyte additives [4] and the introduction of lithiophilic elements on the current collector have been reported [5]. Unfortunately, however, it still seems difficult to nurture all strengths of AFLMBs related to the cost-effectiveness, simple cell design and high-energy density.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>One of the effective ways to regulate electroplating behavior of lithium is to introduce the surface-roughed metal current collector. Using such the structures, the charge accumulation sites on the microscopic structure of current collector can be randomly distributed, resulting in uniform electric field on the surface of current collector. Additionally, the localized current density can be reduced, and problematic volume changes of lithium can be buffered [2].</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this context, we introduced the surface-roughed metal current collector as a substrate of AFLMBs to improve their stability. The surface roughness was controlled by an electrochemical method using a pulse-reverse polarization [6]. In particular, we focused on studying the effect of various pulse parameters on the morphological evolution of a metal current collector. To investigate their effects on the stability of AFLMBs, the CR 2032-type coin cells composed of the roughly surface-treated metal foil as a current collector and high-loading Li-Ni<jats:sub>0.5</jats:sub>Co<jats:sub>0.2</jats:sub>Mn<jats:sub>0.3</jats:sub> (\u2248 12.1 mg/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) as a cathode were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Figure 1-(a)</jats:bold> presents an example of pulse signal used to modify roughness of metal surfaces. First, to investigate effect of pulse current density(i<jats:sub>ox</jats:sub>=i<jats:sub>re</jats:sub>=i), we fixed the amount of metals, which were electrochemically oxidized and reduced by giving different pulse duration time (t<jats:sub>ox</jats:sub> = t<jats:sub>re</jats:sub> = t,). <jats:bold>Figure 1-(b)</jats:bold> presents the effect of pulse current on the morphology of metal foils. After pulse with 0.5 mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, the surface of metal foil is covered by the clusters of metal/metal oxide particles. With increasing current density, the diameter of the clusters decreased and the number of clusters increased. <jats:bold>Figure 2</jats:bold> shows the effect of surface-roughed metal surface on the electroplating behavior of lithium metals. As can be seen in <jats:bold>Figure 2-(a)</jats:bold>, the morphology of electrodeposited lithium on the surface-treated metal foil has a denser and flatter Li deposit than that on pristine metal foil, where a needle-like dendritic structure is shown. <jats:bold>Figure 2-(b)</jats:bold> presents the CE of the repeated plating/stripping process of lithium metal.

It possesses high theoretical capacity of 1672 mAh/g and high theoretical gravimetric energy density of a Li-S cell is approximately 2,510 Wh/kg, which is about eight folds compare to transition metal oxide [1]. The mechanism of lithium sulfur battery is based on the conversion reaction of sulfur to lithium sulfide (Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S) which create high capacity. The transfer of two electrons per sulfur atom is more preferred than one or less than one electron per transition-metal ion [2]. However, tremendous challenges such as natural insulator characteristic of sulfur and lithium sulfide, dissolution of mediators into electrolyte, significant volume change during cycling and lithium metal anode corrosion have hindered the commercialization in industry [3].</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To overcome these drawbacks, the design of the sulfur cathode material plays an important role in boosting sulfur electrochemistry and accelerating the battery performance. In the past few years, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) which consist of metal ions and organic moiety as linker have been used as novel sulfur host materials in lithium sulfur batteries [4]. Particularly, MOFs are prospective as both a precursor and derived materials. The porous carbon materials created from MOFs shows a uniform porosity due to its highly ordered crystalline structures [5]. Besides the confining sulfur within the porous carbon materials, the functional materials have been recently employed to supply both a strong interaction surface with lithium polysulfides and to provide electron transport for enhancing the redox reaction [6]. Moreover, the polysulfide shuttle effect could be manipulated by electrocatalysis [7]. Recent researches found that the atomic cobalt dopants can serve as active sites to improve the kinetics of the sulfur redox reactions. It is therefore pivotal to design an effective electrode that not only improve the electrochemical processes of sulfur but also could efficiently suppress the intermediate polysulfide shuttle effect [8].</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this study, we designed a novel sulfur film coated on the three-dimensional nitrogen and cobalt co-doped carbon polyhedral wrapped on multi-walled carbon nanotubes sponge composite as a high-performance cathode material for rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries. CNTs is employed to supply an interconnected conductive carbon network. Along with the abundant uniform micropores that provided by carbon derived from ZIF 67, sponge-like structure provides abundant mesopores that create favorable pathway for the electrolyte permeability and lithium ion diffusion. The doping of nitrogen and cobalt atom leads to improve electrical conductivity and enhance the surface polarity of the composite. Moreover, the strong interaction between cobalt and lithium polysulfides leads to efficiently suppress the shuttle effect.

This method is well established, and we have compiled data from the literature which reveals a tradeoff between the two parameters. For applications requiring large current densities, the problem is more complicated, especially for composite electrolytes where many parameters (six or more) are required to fully define ion transport. We have applied an approximation to Newman\u2019s concentrated solution theory to define ion transport in a block copolymer electrolyte system (polystyrene-<jats:italic>block</jats:italic>-polyethylene oxide with LiTFSI) with only three transport parameters. We will discuss the results and predictions made by the theory and compare the predictions to experimental data.

However, non-uniform lithium electrodeposition causes low Coulombic efficiency, poor cycling stability, potential safety issues, and has hindered the commercialization of lithium metal batteries at scale. The parasitic reaction of lithium metal with liquid electrolytes results in the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). During cycling, the SEI tends to break continuously, exposing unreacted lithium metal to the electrolyte. This not only promotes non-uniform lithium plating and stripping, but also leads to further SEI formation, which consumes the liquid electrolyte. In addition, the detachment of dendritic lithium from the bulk lithium electrode produces electrically isolated 'dead' lithium during lithium stripping, which no longer participates in the cell reaction. Dendritic lithium and 'dead' lithium formed during cycling largely increase the surface area of the lithium metal anode and consequently accelerates electrolyte consumption. These mechanisms lead to rapid capacity fading and cell failure due to either the complete consumption of the electrolyte or the complete conversion of the lithium metal anode to 'dead' lithium. The formation of lithium metal dendrites can also causes abrupt cell short circuit, which results in thermal runaway.

Therefore, stabilizing the interface of lithium metal is crucial for their application in automotive batteries and grid-scale energy storage devices. In this study, the interface of the lithium metal anode was tailored using a simple and strategical approach by a) regulating uniform deposition and stripping of lithium ions on to the 3-D structured foam and b) stabilizing the cycle life of the anode.

Upon further investigation, it appears that the added component of the mixed artificial SEI, which was meant to improve the ionic conductivity, dissolved into the electrolyte upon initial exposure. This dissolution left behind a new SEI structure, theoretically producing easier ionic pathways and thus resulting in decreased cell overpotential.

Despite its promise, the practical development of Li-S batteries is hindered by its limited cyclability, which is mainly caused by the poor plating and stripping efficiency of the lithium-metal anode. In liquid electrolytes, lithium deposits adopt a mossy dendritic filamentous morphology with high surface area. Due to the reactive nature of lithium, the electrolyte irreversibly decomposes on the lithium surface, which consumes both the lithium and electrolyte supply in the cell. However, significant questions remain about the mechanisms that underlie lithium inventory loss and the role of the lithium-electrolyte interface. Further commercial adoption of Li-S batteries is conditional on developing an effective strategy for improving the reversibility of lithium deposition, which is in turn dependent on developing a clear mechanistic understanding of lithium degradation with cycling.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this study, we use the anode-free full cell configuration, which pairs a Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S cathode with a bare nickel foil as the anode current collector. Since there is no excess lithium in the system (N/P ratio = 1), the cyclability of anode-free full cells depends on the electrochemically accessible lithium inventory in the system. By identifying the sulfur-limited and lithium-limited regimes in the cycling of anode-free full cells, the lithium inventory loss rate per cycle (LILR) can be quantitatively estimated. This parameter provides an effective, robust, and quantifiable description of lithium degradation with cycling in cells with a limited lithium inventory. Lithium degradation displays a strong dependence on the applied current density, with the LILR increasing from 0.6% per cycle to 1.8% per cycle when the current rate is increased from C/10 to C/5.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was applied to analyze the chemical composition of the deposited lithium in the anode-free full cells with different cycle numbers. The integrated intensity for Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n                  <jats:sup>-</jats:sup>, which is indicative of metallic lithium, was found to show negligible variation with cycle number. In contrast, the electrochemically accessible lithium inventory is known to show a clear decrease with cycling. Thus, there is poor correlation between the lithium inventory available with cycle number and the amount of metallic lithium detected with ToF-SIMS. This indicates that lithium inventory depletion in Li-S batteries is not just due to the loss of lithium in parasitic side reactions with the electrolyte to form lithium SEI compounds (Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>), but largely due to the formation of electrochemically inaccessible \u201cdead\u201d metallic lithium. Further analysis with ToF-SIMS revealed the growth of a thick layer of electrolyte decomposition products on the surface of the deposited lithium. Since the decomposition products are expected to be ionically insulating, lithium-ion access to and from the metallic lithium underneath is blocked, which renders it electrochemically inaccessible or \u201cdead\u201d.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The bulk of the deposited lithium is found to be composed of fully reduced decomposition products, such as Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O, Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S, LiH, and LiOH. In particular, the hydrogen-containing decomposition products such as LiH and LiOH are found to show a sharp decrease in concentration with cycling.

These gases include H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, and C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>H<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, and their generation is correlated with the loss of lithium inventory with cycling.

The framework demonstrated in this work and the conclusions drawn are applicable not just to Li-S batteries, but to lithium-metal-based batteries in general.

But lithium dendrite issues tend to exacerbate at high currents. LiF can be considered as an effective way to improve the Li metal surface electrochemical stability to achieve high power and high energy. However, most of reported work are relying on in situ formation of a 2D LiF on Li metal in liquid electrolyte, which limits the scalability and plated Li quantity. Here, we address this challenge and report a scalable synthesis of LiF\u2010rich 3D architected Li metal anode via a direct pyrolysis of molten lithium and fluoropolymer to enable fast Li charging with high current density (20\u00a0mA\u00a0cm<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup>) and high areal capacity (20\u00a0mAh\u00a0cm<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup>).

PEO/LiTFSI/BC composite solid polymer electrolytes (CSPE) are prepared easily by aqueous mixing in water. The lithium ion transference number of PEO/LiTFSI/BC CSPE is 0.57, which is higher than PEO/LiTFSI solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) (0.409). The PEO/LiTFSI/BC CSPE exhibits larger tensile strength (4.43\u00a0MPa) than PEO/LiTFSI SPE (1.34\u00a0MPa). The electrochemical window of composite electrolyte is widened 1.43\u00a0V by adding BC.

Unfortunately, the lithium metal anode falls subject to several challenges such as dendrite formation and low Coulombic efficiency, which inhibit its candidacy as a viable technology. As such, substantial research efforts alter cell parameters in effort to manipulate interfacial chemistries, mitigate dendrite growth, and improve cyclability. Unlike conventional efforts, we demonstrate a practical cell operation approach to reinforce the Solid Electrolyte Interphase in lithium anodes via a refined formation protocol governed by the redox reactions found in lithium\u2010sulfur systems. Galvanostatic and electrochemical impedance data on Li\u2010Li symmetrical cells reveal that cell operation during the formation phase plays a critical role on interface stability of lithium metal anodes. Li\u2010Li symmetrical cells subject to our refined protocol, P2, displayed advantages in steadily enduring high cycling currents of 6 mA with minimal polarization, and in lowering the charge transfer resistance at the cell interfaces by a fourfold when compared to cells subject to conventional formation protocols. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy images demonstrate that our formation protocol significantly minimizes the size and dispersion of lithium dendrites, as well as the degree of plated lithium. These effects are enabled by the reinforced SEI formed during P2 which offers a stable ratio between the rates of lithium intercalation to lithium deposition. Microcomputerized tomography characterization further supports these findings by revealing that P2 averts dendrite nucleation sites, and yields greater quantity of SEI species, encompassing 41.1% volume of the entire anode, compared to just 21.5% from the common formation protocol found in literature. Overall, this approach deviates from the convention of materials exploration yet highlights the importance of understanding the nature of interfacial chemistries in response to cell operation. We believe the transferability of this approach has the potential to expedite the commercialization of next\u2010generation lithium ion technologies.</jats:p>"}

Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> battery has a significantly higher theoretical energy density than conventional Li-ion batteries by using lithium metal anode which has the lowest electrochemical potential(-3.04V versus the standard hydrogen electrode) and unlimited cathode active material. However, Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> battery still suffers from drawbacks such sluggish ORR/OER kinetics at the cathode, dendrite growth on the lithium metal anode and the decomposition of the electrolyte. In ORR/OER process, lithium oxide intermediate, LiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is generated at the cathode/electrolyte interface. It induces a high discharge/charge overpotential, which reduces round trip efficiency. And also due to its high reactivity, it makes side product reacting with electrolyte. Due to sluggish ORR/OER kinetics, LiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> residues in the electrolyte for a long period thereby increases overpotential and reacts with electrolyte severely. It was previously reported that lithium powder electrode inhibits dendrite growth by reducing the effective current density. Also it has a capability to use more Li than conventional lithium foil electrode. In this study, lithium powder electrode(LPE) was applied as an anode in Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> battery. It is proposed that lithium powder electrode not only inhibits dendrite growth on anode but also increases lithium ion diffusion thus promoting the ORR/OER kinetics at the cathode. By Cyclic voltammetry(CV) and Linear sweep voltammetry(LSV), it was confirmed that lithium powder increased kinetics of the cathodic reaction and also lithium ion diffusion coefficient was calculated using Randles-sevcik equation. The result showed that lithium powder enhances lithium ion diffusion at the cathode by increasing the electrochemically active surface area when comparing with lithium foil electrode. The morphology and chemical reaction after cycling was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy(FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS) also demonstrated that side product on cathode of LPE used Li-O<jats:sub>2 </jats:sub>battery was reduced.

In conclusion, the larger electrochemically active surface area of LPE enhances the lithium ion diffusion thereby promotes ORR/OER kinetics and reduces LiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> residual time. As a result, improved kinetics and reduced residual time of LiO<jats:sub>2 </jats:sub>contribute to the higher discharge capacity, better cycle performance and decreased side reaction product.    </jats:p>"}

In this work, we present a highly porous electrode based on graphite nanosheets (GNS) and discuss the impact of the discharge current density and the oxygen pressure as battery test parameters, as well as the electrolyte salt and volume, on the discharge behavior. In particular, changing the electrolyte salt from LiNO3 to LiTFSI proved to be an important step towards better cell performance, because synergistic effects of the electrolyte and GNS greatly enhance the carbon-specific capacity. The optimized combination of the aforementioned parameters enabled a remarkably high discharge capacity of 56.3 mAh/cm2 (5860 mAh/gcarbon) obtained at 150 \u00b5A/cm2 (15.6 mA/gcarbon), resulting in the almost complete conversion of the lithium anode.

It is reported recently that the presence of magnetic field can improve the cyclability and prevent the growth of lithium dendrites. However, it is unclear how, in detail, magnetic field affects lithium anodes. Herein, a competition relationship is proposed for understanding magnetic effect on lithium anodes. Magnetic field induces multiple magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects in a cell. These effects include an uneven current distribution across the electrode, enhanced mass transport, and redistribution of lithium ions around lithium dendrites. While the first effect promotes dendritic growth, the latter two benefit preventing their growth. Thus, the first competes with the latter two. Herein, it is shown that uneven current distribution can be the domain effect. It leads to earlier short circuits caused by dendrites and shortens the cycle life of lithium anodes through a higher electrolyte decomposition rate. As it appears to be an emerging approach to improve the performance of lithium anodes and rechargeable batteries using magnetic field, challenges and opportunities are discussed.</jats:p></jats:sec>"}

Compelling ceramic lithium conductors with ionic conductivities surpassing those of conventional liquid electrolytes have been developed, but they suffer from high fabrication and processing costs. Moreover, achieving intimate solid-solid contact at the electrolyte-electrode interface is challenging. Polymer electrolytes are alternative materials that offer processing ease and the ability to fully infiltrate and wet composite electrodes. Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) mixed with lithium salt is the archetypical polymer electrolyte and solid-state cells using LiFePO<jats:sub>4 </jats:sub>cathode and lithium metal anode have been successfully commercialized. However, a significant limitation of PEO is its low oxidative stability, which restricts its application to lower voltage cathode (e.g. LiFePO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>). Thus, polymer electrolytes with higher oxidative stabilities are desperately needed. In previous work, our group investigated hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR) as a candidate for high-voltage application because of its superior oxidative stability of 5.3 V vs. Li/Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>. This polymer readily dissolves lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) salt and has a high lithium transference number (0.59 compared to 0.37 for PEO). However, HNBR-LiTFSI suffers from low ionic conductivity (3.6\u00d710<jats:sup>-8</jats:sup> S\u00b7cm<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> at 20\u00b0C), which severely limits transport in full solid-state cells.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> In this work, phthalates were employed as the plasticizer to increase the conductivity of the HNBR-based electrolyte. FTIR shows that phthalates not only enhance the segmental mobility of the polymer chains but also coordinate with Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> and participate in the solvation of lithium salt. Phthalates have a broad liquid-phase window preventing potential phase separation in the polymer electrolyte and evaporation at elevated temperatures. Their low HOMOs (e.g. -10.7 eV for di-ethyl-phthalate) should translate to higher oxidative resistance. A series of di-alkyl-phthalate homologues differing in the length of the alkyl branches were investigated in this report. Plasticized polymer electrolytes were prepared by blending HNBR-LiTFSI and a given amount of phthalate in acetone solution, and then casting into a mold and evaporating the volatile acetone. The plasticized electrolyte can withstand 159\u00b0C without significant evaporation; the decomposition of HNBR occurs at over 400\u00b0C even in a pure O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> environment. The conductivity of HNBR-LiTFSI with di-ethyl-phthalate (up to 20 wt.%) was 7.3\u00d710<jats:sup>-7</jats:sup> S\u00b7cm<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> at 20\u00b0C and 4.4\u00d710<jats:sup>-5</jats:sup> S\u00b7cm<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> at 70\u00b0C. The electrochemical oxidative stability of both HNBR-LiTFSI and plasticized-HNBR-LiTFSI was assessed by linear sweep voltammetry. The oxidation potential was reduced from 5.3 V to 5.2 V vs. Li/Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> after introducing phthalates. Electrochemical impedance analysis showed that a resistive interface developed between HNBR-based electrolytes and lithium, indicating a chemical incompatibility between HNBR and lithium metal. However, this problem was readily addressed through a laminated electrolyte structure where a layer of PEO/LiTFSI physically separated plasticized HNBR/LiTFSI from direct contact with lithium metal. The effectiveness of this structure was confirmed by over 2000 hours of reversible galvanostatic cycling of symmetric lithium metal electrodes at 70\u00b0C.    </jats:p>"}

The lithium metal is attracting worldwide attention as an anode material for next-generation lithium-based secondary battery such as a lithium air battery (LAB) because of its high capacity (3860 mA h g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) and negative reduction potential (-3.04 V vs. SHE). However, the formation of lithium dendrites, which cause short circuit, low Coulombic efficiency, and short cycling lifespan, on the electrode surface is one of the biggest issues to practically use the LAB. During lithium deposition, moreover, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which is produced by the decomposition of solvents and/or electrolytes, is also accumulated on electrode. In order to suppress lithium dendrite formation [1], we are trying to produce the ideal SEI, which has high lithium ion conductivity, low electron conductivity, and uniform composition with an appropriated thickness [2].

The effect of electrolyte type on the electrochemical performance of a LiCoO2 cathode and a SnO2/C composite anode in lithium anode (or cathode) half-cells was also investigated. The results demonstrated that the addition of 5 wt.% succinonitrile (SN) resulted in enhanced ionic conductivity of a 60% EMI-TFSI 40% EC/DMC MOILE from ~14 mS\u00b7cm\u22121 to ~26 mS\u00b7cm\u22121 at room temperature. Additionally, at a temperature of 100 \u00b0C, an increase in ionic conductivity from ~38 to ~69 mS\u00b7cm\u22121 was observed for the MOILE with 5 wt% SN. The improvement in the ionic conductivity is attributed to the high polarity of SN and its ability to dissolve various types of salts such as LiTFSI. The galvanostatic charge/discharge results showed that the LiCoO2 cathode with the MOILE (without SN) exhibited a 39% specific capacity loss at the 50th cycle while the LiCoO2 cathode in the MOILE with 5 wt.% SN showed a decrease in specific capacity of only 14%. The addition of 5 wt.% SN to the MOILE with a SnO2/C composite-fiber anode resulted in improved cycling performance and rate capability of the SnO2/C composite-membrane anode in lithium anode half-cells. Based on the results reported in this work, a new avenue and promising outcome for the future use of MOILEs with SN in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) can be opened.</jats:p>"}

Solid-state electrolytes have emerged as an appealing alternative to flammable organic liquid electrolytes, with the potential to accommodate higher-voltage cathode materials and a metallic lithium anode. Despite the discoveries of solid electrolyte materials exhibiting superionic conductivities, capacity loss and rate performance degradation has been commonly observed due to the prevailing issue of electrolyte/electrode interface reactivity, which originates from abrupt electrochemical potential changes at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The cycling stability of solid-state lithium ion batteries can be improved through the use of interfacial coating materials, but computationally identifying materials with sufficiently high lithium-ion conductivity can be challenging. Methods such as ab initio molecular dynamics that work well for superionic conductors can be prohibitively expensive when used on materials that conduct lithium ions less well but are still suitable for use as interfacial coatings. We demonstrate a way to address this problem using machine-learned interatomic potentials models in the form of moment tensor potentials. To prevent the potentials from significantly deviating from density functional theory (DFT) calculations we use molecular dynamics simulations coupled with on-the-fly machine learning.

After the failure of the Holy Grail lithium metal anode, in the 1990s, graphite captured the lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) market and has been its mainstay for the past three decades. However, because of limited theoretical capacity (372 mAh g<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>), alloy materials like Ge, Si, Sb and Sn garnered a great amount of attention owing to their high extravagant theoretical capacity. Amongst all, silicon is considered the likely promising candidate for the next generation LIBs, however significant challenges (e.g. electrode pulverization, volume expansion, particle fragmentation, excessive solid electrolyte interface formation etc.) need to be addressed for achieving long stable cycle life. Different approaches to overcome the aforementioned issues have been tried for better handling of stress built up on account of volume changes, which include designing nanostructures, or nanocomposites. Despite promising electrochemistry performance, critical problems need to be addressed viz., uneconomical and complex processes, accelerated side reactions due to the high surface area, low tap density, and poor scalability.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To tackle these complex issues, we designed a novel silicon-graphite anode interfaced with amorphous carbon derived from inexpensive starch. The presence of amorphous carbon helps accommodate the volume expansion along with enhanced electrical conductivity between Si nanoparticles and graphite particles. The synthesis process for silicon composite (GCSi) composite utilizes a pyrolysis technique, which can be easily scaled up, in an inert environment by homogeneously ball-milling Si-NPs, starch powder, and graphite.

The dehydrogenation and carbonization of the starch started around at 400\u2103 and finished about 500\u2103. With the homogenization of starch particles, they appeared to merge with the graphite.

All-solid-state battery is a promising battery form to achieve high energy density. Since solid-electrolyte has a wider potential window than a liquid one, high voltage cathode material can be implemented. Among novel cathode materials, we focus on a Li-rich manganese oxide Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>MnO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, which has a layered rock-salt structure with a honeycomb-ordered LiMn<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> layer. Although having a high theoretical capacity of ~459 mAh g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>, the cathode delivers a smaller reversible capacity than the theoretical value. Recently, we have found that an all-solid-state battery with a Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>MnO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> thin film can deliver a reversibly capacity of 270 mAh g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>, and the rate and cyclic performance are extremely high [1]. However, the redox species of the Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>MnO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> during the electrochemical charge/discharge reactions are still unknown for this battery system.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> In this study, the charge compensation mechanism of the Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>MnO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> cathode in an all-solid-state thin film battery was investigated by using an <jats:italic>operando</jats:italic> hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) method. Although X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is a powerful method to investigate the electronic structure of the cathode, there is an issue that the probing depth is about a few nm when using Al or Mg Ka source. On the other hand, HAXPES has a high probing depth of several 10 nm, which makes it possible to detect a signal from the buried region of the battery.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Solid-electrolyte supported thin film batteries were developed for HAXPES measurement as illustrated in Fig (a). Using solid-electrolyte as substrate, cathode, and anode layers can be separated on the front and the back of the substrate, respectively, which enables us to detect the HAXPES signal of the cathode layer. The battery composed of a polycrystalline Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>MnO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> cathode, an amorphous Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> buffer layer, a lithium anode, an Al current collector, and a LICGC glass-ceramics solid-electrolyte substrate (manufactured by Ohara Inc.) was prepared by using pulsed laser deposition, magnetron sputtering, and thermal or electron-beam vapor deposition methods. Charge-discharge experiments were performed galvanostatically at a 0.2 C rate between 2.0 and 5.0 V (<jats:italic>vs.</jats:italic> Li/Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>) at room temperature. After the cell voltage reached at 5.0 V, the voltage was kept for 30 minutes.An operando HAXPES measurement was conducted at BL28XU in SPring-8. The incident photon energy of 7940 eV was used. The <jats:italic>operando</jats:italic> O1s, Mn3s, and Li1s spectra were measured during the 1<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> and the 5<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> charge-discharge processes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> The charge-discharge curves showed a plateau at 4.6 V in the 1<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> charge and slope-like curves from the 1<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> discharge. Since these characteristics are also identified in the case of the battery using the Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>MnO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> epitaxial thin film [1], the prepared battery is suitable to conduct a HAXPES measurement for the purpose. The figures (b, c) show O1s <jats:italic>operando</jats:italic> spectra during the 1<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> charge-discharge process. During the 1<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> charge, a new peak at 531.1 eV is generated from 3.7 V in addition to a lattice oxygen O<jats:sup>2-</jats:sup> at 529.8 eV. According to previous reports, the new peak can be assigned as higher oxidized lattice oxygen such as O<jats:sup>- </jats:sup>[2]. After 3.7 V, the area of the new peak increases while that of O<jats:sup>2- </jats:sup>decreases as the voltage increases. During the 1<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> discharge, the new peak gradually decreases and then disappears at 3.3 V. Therefore, the reversible oxygen redox could contribute the charge compensation for the battery reactions. The average valence state of Mn was analyzed from Mn3s operando spectra. Manganese is reduced from 4+ to 3.5+ during the 1st charge process then Mn is further reduced to 3.1+ from 3.3 V during 1<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> discharging process. Upon the 5<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> charge-discharge process, the Mn redox occurred reversibly below 3.5 V.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> These results indicate that the oxygen as well as Mn redox reactions occur reversibly in Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>MnO<jats:sub>3 </jats:sub>cathode. Furthermore, the oxygen redox occurs on the higher voltage region between ~3.3 and 5.0 V and the Mn redox occurs on the lower region between 2.0 and ~3.3 V. Therefore, it is evident that the large reversible capacity of Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>MnO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> thin film results from the oxygen redox activity.

The FAS treatment allows for control of graphene structural order and chemical uniformity not possible through prior top-down wet methods. Graphite is exfoliated into single-nm scale thickness graphene that is nearly defect free (at-edge sonication graphene \"AES-G\") or is highly defective (in-plane sonication graphene \"IPS-G\").

The graphene serves a dual role in stabilizing the Na metal anode, being a nucleation template and serving as a protective layer to keep the metal from severely reacting with the electrolyte. We are the first to demonstrate that graphene defects are actually quite deleterious for efficient Na plating and stripping. AES-G yields state-of-the-art Na performance, with stable cycling at 2 mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> at 100% Coulombic efficiency (CE), and an areal capacity of 1 mAh/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. Meanwhile IPS-G performs on-par with the baseline Cu support in terms of severe charging instability. The explanation is that the defective graphene demonstrates much more copious SEI formation due to its defects and oxygen groups being catalytic. A thicker SEI results in a larger overpotential and worse CE loss during subsequent Na plating/stripping, manifesting in severe mossy metal dendrite growth and periodic electrical shorts.

However, the irreversible consumption of electrolytes and the disordered dendrites growth could cause the low Coulombic efficiency and safety issues hindering the lithium anode from the commercialization. Various schemes, such as structured Li anodes, artificial SEI, and various electrolyte additives have been proposed to decouple the cycling lifespan of metallic Li anode with the dendritic growth. As one of the most critical components, the modification of the electrolyte will be one promising and complementary approach for preparing high performance Li metal battery. Inspired by these challenges, in this presentation the effects of novel highly concentrated electrolytes (HCEs) and diluted high concentration electrolytes (DHCEs) on the electrochemical performances of the Li metal anodes is provided. HCEs significantly improve the stability of lithium metal anodes, but applications are often impeded by their limitation of density, viscosity, and cost. To address such shortcomings without sacrificing their superiority in cycling performance, we introduce a new co-solvent to dilute the HCE. The performance of novel DHCE is further demonstrated in full cells under practical conditions, including ambient to low temperature (\u221220 \u00b0C), high areal capacity (7.6 mAh cm<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup>), high current density (3 mA cm<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup>), limited excess Li (20 \u03bcm Li), and lean electrolyte (3 g Ah<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>).     </jats:p>"}

A promising new technology is the so-called Li metal Solid State Battery (SSB), which aims to replace the flammable liquid electrolyte by solid electrolyte materials, such as ceramics or polymers. Ceramic electrolytes are the best candidates for SSB in terms of high Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> conductivity, though they are strongly limited by their mechanical properties and the limited interfacial contact with Li metal anode. On the other hand, polymer electrolytes present good mechanical properties with a high degree of processability, whereas a low ionic conductivity limits them at RT.

Nevertheless, the intrinsic instability of the Li metal towards both solid and liquid electrolytes leads to unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and dendritic lithium, causing safety concerns and rapid performance degradation [1]. Among the potential techniques used to protect the Li metal surface and inhibit dendrite growth, molecular layer deposition (MLD) has proven to be an invaluable tool for the development of nanoscale interfacial coatings with unique properties [2]. The layer-by-layer assembly of molecular fragments and conformal coating abilities of MLD yield the ability to tune the chemical and mechanical properties of the Li metal interface. It is believed that the exploration and adoption of new MLD films will open up new avenues for stabilizing the Li metal anode. Herein, we show several examples of high-performance Li metal anodes in liquid and solid-state systems achieved by polymeric coatings synthesized through MLD techniques [3-8]. New hybrid organic-inorganic coatings belonging to the metalcone family are shown to dramatically enhance the Coulombic efficiency and rate capability of Li metal anodes. Furthermore, the rational design and ordering of these coatings coupled with inorganic atomic layer deposition coatings reveal the importance of bilayer type structures in promoting enhanced mechanical properties for suppressing dendrite growth. The stabilizing properties of these advanced thin films are further extended to several next-generation battery systems including Li-S and Li-O<jats:sub>2, </jats:sub>proving effective when coupled with high energy density cathode materials. Moreover, advanced characterization techniques such as in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, nanoindentation measurements, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry are used to reveal the mechanisms behind the electrochemical lithiation processes as well as cycling stability.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>References</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] Cheng, X.B.; Zhang, R.; Zhao, C.Z.; Zhang Q.

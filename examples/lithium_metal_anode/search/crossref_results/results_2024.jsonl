Making trade-off between capacity reduction caused by the SEI layer and better cycle stability significantly limits the general performance of lithium metal batteries. In this research, characteristics of SEI layers and some significant advancements made in SEI formation are outlined. Some designs for the SEI layers on the lithium metal anodes include designing hybrid polymer SEI layers, producing synthetic SEI layers.

Secondly, we analyze how differing pressure conditions affect the topography of lithium deposits by coupling the nonlinear phase-field model with the force model.

Meanwhile, positive electrodes have oxidation potentials of 4.2 V or higher, and the reactivity at the positive electrode (cathode) and the electrolyte interface (CEI) is also a crucial factor influencing the performance of lithium metal batteries. Thus, controlling the reactions of the electrolyte solution at the electrode interface is a critical factor for operating lithium metal batteries stably and reliably over the long term.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In recent years, research and development of electrolyte solutions have focused on enhancing reduction and oxidation stability by exploring various types of solvents, electrolyte salts, and controlling their concentrations. Ether-based electrolyte solutions are known for their higher reduction stability comparing commercially available carbonate-based electrolyte solutions. However, the oxidative stability of conventional concentration ether-based electrolyte solution is quite low, leading the decomposition at oxidation potentials over 4 V. Strategies to improve the oxidative stability of ether-based electrolyte solutions have been extensively studied, and one of the candidates is increasing electrolyte salt concentration.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this study, we have conducted electrochemical performance tests on lithium metal batteries using a concentrated electrolyte solution of ether-based solvents and LiFSI (Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide), with lithium metal and NCM positive electrode. As the solvation structures in the electrolyte solution directly affect the formation mechanism of SEI and CEI, the solvation structures are estimated by Raman spectroscopy, and their chemical stability and decomposition mechanisms are estimated by DFT calculations. We have conducted detailed analyses of reduction and oxidative decomposition reactions occurring at the electrode surface, and confirmed the applicability of the prediction combining Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>"}

Therefore, the PCM uniformly coated with molten lithium (PCM-Li) achieved a thickness of 38 \u03bcm and a light weight of 11.9 mg cm<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup>. In symmetrical cell evaluation under 1mAh cm<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup>\n                  <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>@1mA cm<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup>\n                  <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, the PCM-Li showed an ultrastable overpotential of 9.6 mV over 1,000 cycles. Furthermore, the PCM-Li maintained stable voltage behavior for more than 600 h even under 5mAh cm<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup>@5mA cm<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup>. Interestingly, in the SEM image of the PCM-Li after 1,000 cycles, no mossy or dendritic Li was observed, as Li was epitaxially plated along the flat Cu wires. Finally, we assembled a 1-Ah-scale high-energy LMB (351 Wh kg<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup>\n                  <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>) with the PCM-Li anodes and dry-coated NCM811 cathodes to demonstrate practical application. The LMB using the PCM-Li represented excellent practicality showing capacity retention of 80% during 200 cycles. This facile physical approach is helpful to the commercialization of next-generation lithium-based batteries and broadens the scope for subsequent research, such as lithiophilic materials coating for anode-free batteries.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>"}

While lithium-ion batteries have been the staple, their energy density development has been slow, and at gravimetric energy densities of around 250 Wh/kg, they are approaching their theoretical limit.<jats:sup>1 </jats:sup>The lithium-metal battery (LMB) is considered a next-generation battery due to high theoretical energy densities (ex: Lithium-Sulfur, 2600 Wh/kg), and lithium metal\u2019s high gravimetric capacity (3860 mAh/g) and low reduction potential (-3.04 V vs S.H.E.). However, commercialization of LMBs has been limited due to various issues.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Two properties that dictate the performance of the LMBs are: 1. The composition of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), an electronically conducting, yet passivating, layer at the anode-electrolyte interface, and 2. The morphology of the lithium deposited at the anode. Morphological studies focus on creating dense, low surface area, deposits that limit SEI fracturing and the formation of electronically disconnected lithium. SEI quality is improved by incorporating inorganic or anion-rich SEIs, formed from the electrolyte salt, to promote SEIs that are mechanically robust, ionically conducting, and homogeneous. Our group\u2019s previous work aimed to improve LMB performance via both routes by growing resistive Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3 </jats:sub>coatings on the copper (Cu) current collector using atomic layer deposition (ALD). Defects in the thin film create areas of low resistance that behave like ultramicroelectrodes which encourage radial diffusion of lithium ions to the nuclei promoting lateral growth and producing low surface area, dense, planar lithium deposits. Simultaneously, the Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3 </jats:sub>coating\u2019s Lewis acidic properties promote the decomposition and subsequent incorporation of inorganic electrolyte species into the SEI.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We present a study of how the different interfaces present at the anode in LMBs impact SEI composition and battery performance. To hold the Li nucleation morphology at the anode constant, we deposit metal oxide films of a fixed resistance onto the Cu current collector, generating planar, low surface area, lithium deposits. This experimental design allows us to decouple the effect of the metal oxide thin film-electrolyte interface on SEI quality and battery performance from that of the lithium morphology. First, as shown in Fig. 1a, different metal oxide films of equal resistance, but different thicknesses, are grown via ALD, confirmed by measuring the first-cycle nucleation overpotential. The resistive metal oxides investigated are Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3, </jats:sub>HfO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, AlHf<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>y</jats:sub>, and ZrO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. Scanning electron microscopy results indicate that all cells modified with equal resistance metal oxide films exhibit the same low surface area, dense, planar Li nucleation morphology. However, long-term cycling tests show differences in cell performance and life cycle. Subsequently, the composition of the SEI is investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Through XPS, an elemental atomic ratio analysis is conducted to investigate the relative number of species derived from the anion of the electrolyte versus the solvent of the electrolyte to reflect the anion-derived nature of the SEI. Additionally, high-resolution peaks are used to determine the relative abundance of high-quality SEI species such as lithium fluoride. This analysis confirms that the metal oxide thin film tunes the SEI composition. Additionally, we identify trends present between the SEI quality of the ALD-modified cell and its performance.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To further investigate the thin film-electrolyte interface, a set of cells modified with binary stacked metal oxide thin films with two different stack orders were created, as shown in Fig. 1b. Investigating SEI composition and LMB performance, with the morphology fixed by the nucleation overpotential, allowed for deconvolution of the impact of the Cu-thin film interface and thin film-electrolyte interface. Both interfaces can in principle impact the battery\u2019s function because 1. The Cu-thin film interface controls the electron transport to form Li<jats:sup>o </jats:sup>from Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ion during electrodeposition, and 2. The thin film-electrolyte interface can modulate the SEI. Our results indicated that the SEI and performance were both primarily regulated by the thin film-electrolyte interface. Based on our fixed-resistance and binary stack experimental design, we propose that modulation of the SEI composition by the metal oxide coating controls LMB performance when the Li nucleation morphology is fixed. This result suggests the potential for tuning LMB performance by careful selection of the metal oxide interfacial coating.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>References </jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>(1) Cheng, X.-B., et al.

In this work, Poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) was incorporated into PVDF-HFP in order to reduce the crystallinity of the PVDF-HFP matrix, improve the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, and greatly reduce the interfacial impedance of the electrolyte by utilizing the low-temperature flexibility, excellent amorphous nature, and strong bonding properties of PVAc.

This research investigated a dry-cold sintering process (dry-CSP) to Ta doped-LLZO (LLZTO), in which the LLZTO powder was pressed by cold isostatic pressing (CIP) at 40 MPa without solvent addition and then heated at 300oC for 2h. XRD analysis found that LLZTO300C40P remains crystallized in a single cubic with ionic conductivity of (3.02\uf0b1 0.53) x 10-5 Scm-1, which is higher than another result in Al doped-LLZO by CSP uniaxial pressing and with moistened-solvent (wet-CSP). The feasibility was tested by preparing a coin cell with a LiCoO2 cathode and Li metal anode. Cyclic voltammogram of the LCO-LLZTO300C40P-Li ASSB provides a high current density representing a higher electrochemical reaction rate inside the full cell.

However, during fast charging, lithium dendrites growth occur at the surface of Li metal anode, resulting in short circuiting, thermal runaway, and fire event. Under high-voltages beyond 4.2 V, lithium dendrites growth and structural degradation of cathode active material will be accelerated, leading to faster performance fade and higher risk of short circuiting. Herein, we demonstrate the significant impacts of fluorinated organic additive that enables ultrafast charging 400 cycles performance of Li//Mn-rich LMB under extreme conditions of 20 C (charged in 3 minutes) and charge cut-off voltage of 4.8 V, without lithium dendrites. Stable performance and high tolerance to extreme conditions are ascribed to the additive-derived formation of uniform and robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers at Li metal anode and Mn-rich cathode.

The Li\u2010ion transfer mechanism is verified and works across the entire LSE\u2010HFC, which facilitates homogeneous Li\u2010ion flux and low migration energy barriers, endowing LSE\u2010HFC with high ionic conductivity of 5.62\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<jats:sup>\u22124</jats:sup>\u00a0S\u00a0cm<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> and Li\u2010ion transference number of 0.78 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Combining the outstanding mechanical strength against punctures and the enhanced adhesion force with electrodes, LSE\u2010HFC harvests uniform Li plating/stripping behavior. These enable the realization of high\u2010energy\u2010density ASSLMBs with excellent cycling stability when being assembled as LiFePO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/Li and LiNi<jats:sub>0.6</jats:sub>Mn<jats:sub>0.2</jats:sub>Co<jats:sub>0.2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/Li cells.</jats:p>"}

Li metal battery (LMB) with Li metal anode and LiNi<jats:sub>1-x-y</jats:sub>Mn<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>Co<jats:sub>y</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (NMC) cathode represents the next generation high energy density electrochemical energy storage devices. A major challenge facing LMB is finding an electrolyte that is capable of forming good interphases and enabling stable cycling. A common practice is fluorinating the electrolyte to generate anion-derived interphase rich in LiF. Electrolytes based on this strategy can lead to long cycle life. However, they usually have low ionic conductivities and cannot enable the fast-charging capabilities. By using CsNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> as a dual-functional additive, a good interphases on both NMC cathode and Li metal anode is formed for long cycle life of LMB. Such strategy allows the use of 1,2-dimethoxyethane as the single solvent which guarantees superior ion transport properties and hence fast charging capabilities. The cathode is protected by the nitrate-derived species. On lithium metal anode side, the gigantic Cs+ cations have weak interactions with the solvents, allowing the anions to enter the solvation sheath and contribute to the interphase formation. The resulting interphase is composed of anion-derived species as expected but surprisingly dominated by the inorganic species cesium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, or CsFSI, an interphase component that has never been reported. The active participation of Cs+ in the interphase formation suggests that Cs+ may be doing much more than just serving as electrostatic shield as commonly believed. In addition, the interphase has low content of LiF which is usually regarded as a key component for good interphase. Interestingly, the low content of LiF does not impact the quality of the interphase in any negative way. This is demonstrated by the good performance of LiNi<jats:sub>0.8</jats:sub>Mn<jats:sub>0.1</jats:sub>Co<jats:sub>0.1</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>||Li cell. Even with very high cathode loading (21mg/cm<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> or 5mAh/cm<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) and a low N/P ratio of 2, LMB cell can be cycled at 1C rate (~8mA/cm<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) and retains more than 80% of initial capacity after 200 cycles. This work calls attention to re- examining the role of LiF in the interphase and the role of Cs-containing additive in the electrolyte.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The second part of this presentation will be focused on Evolution and Interplay of Lithium Metal Interphase Components of lithium metal batteries. LMBs have high energy densities and are crucial for clean energy solutions. The characterization of lithium metal interphase is fundamentally and practically important but technically challenging. Taking advantage of synchrotron x-ray which has the unique capability of analyzing crystalline/amorphous phases quantitatively with statistical reliability, we have studied the composition and dynamics of LMB interphase for a newly developed important LMB electrolyte that is based on fluorinated ether. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis revealed the sequential role of anion and solvent in interphase formation during cycling. The relative ratio between Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O and LiF first increases and then decreases during cycling, suggesting suppressed Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O formation in both initial and long extended cycles.

Consequently, in the pursuit of post-lithium ion batteries with enhanced energy density, the utilization of lithium metal as an anode is inevitable. However, the stability and safety of lithium metal anodes are compromised by issues such as dendritic growth. When lithium metal comes into contact with organic electrolytes, it reacts to form a solid electrolyte interface (SEI).

However, several drawbacks still exist in case of liquid LSB-concepts, especially cycling stability with low electrolyte excess in combination with a reasonable sulfur utilization plus cycle stability still hinders the commercial breakthrough of this battery technology. One main reason for both issues is the dissolution of the active material, sulfur, as polysulfides in the electrolyte, which leads to the so-called polysulfide shuttle that comprises polysulfide diffusion through the cell to the lithium metal anode resulting in decomposition reactions, and therefore, loss of active material. Several electrolyte approaches in order to limit polysulfide dissolution have been developed over the last 5-10 years, however, those electrolyte formulations usually lead to a strong lithium metal corrosion. Electrolytes that enable stable cycling of lithium metal batteries in combination with a nickel manganese cobalt oxide cathode have been successfully developed, however, they are ususally not compatible with the polysulfides of Li-S batteries. Hence, decoupling the anolyte from the catholyte has been much desirable. Recently introduced solid-state lithium sulfur batteries based on sulfidic solid electrolytes might overcome some challenges of conventional liquid LSBs since no formation or diffusion of polysulfide species can take place, and very high sulfur utilization have been already reached.

In this talk, the development of a diamond based operando cell and its application to the characterization of organosulfur and fluorinated electrolytes will be discussed. With the understanding developed from these two techniques we provide new insights into the formation and chemical nature of SEI components that promote stable cycling of lithium metal electrodes.    </jats:p>"}

Here, I will present my group\u2019s recent work on understanding structural evolution, interfacial dynamics, and chemo-mechanics in solid-state batteries with both lithium metal and alloy-based anodes. Lithium metal batteries are especially beneficial if used in an \u201canode-free\u201d configuration in which there is no lithium initially present at the anode current collector. Using X-ray tomography, cryo-FIB, and finite-element modeling, we show that lithium metal anode-free solid-state batteries are intrinsically limited by current concentrations at the end of stripping due to localized lithium depletion. This causes accelerated short circuiting compared to lithium-excess cells. Based on these results, the beneficial influence of metal alloy interfacial layers on controlling lithium evolution and mitigating contact loss from localized lithium depletion will be introduced and discussed. In the second part of the talk, the characteristics of dense, foil-based alloy anodes are introduced. Alloy foils such as aluminum and tin are shown to exhibit improved interfacial stability and better long-term cycling in solid-state batteries compared to liquid-cell batteries due to reduced solid-electrolyte interphase formation. A new design for multiphase aluminum foil alloy anodes is introduced, in which microstructural control over the foil is shown to play a key role in significantly improving reversibility in solid-state batteries. This anode design mitigates chemo-mechanical degradation and offers a paradigm that does away with slurry coating, potentially reducing manufacturing costs. The influence of stack pressure on electrode evolution is investigated. Taken together, these findings show the promise of both lithium metal and alloy anodes for solid-state batteries, with divergent reaction mechanisms giving rise to different operating conditions necessary for each class of materials.    </jats:p>"}

The results showed that, in contrast to traditional cationic surfactants cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and hexadecylpyridinium bromide, which we studied earlier, decalin and perfluorodecalin demonstrate specific interaction with the surface of the lithium electrode. Moreover, the interaction with decalin is so strong that it actually blocks the processes of both deposition and anodic dissolution of lithium at the surface of the lithium electrode.

In order to inform solvation shell dynamics and SEI formation, this work explores 2 common salts (NaPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> and NaTFSI) and 2 common solvents (diglyme and FEC) employed in sodium metal battery electrolytes. The selected components possess a range of desirable molecular structures bulk properties, allowing us to diagram the connections between their solvation structures and bulk solution phase properties.

In this work, we introduce a novel approach by developing a composite separator, termed PVDF-INO, which integrates In(NO3)3 (INO) into polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) to create a 12 \u03bcm thick layer. This addition significantly enhances the interaction between the separator and the electrolyte, creating a lithophilic matrix that ensures an even distribution of lithium ions. This uniform ion distribution promotes consistent lithium deposition and dissolution, resulting in a durable, dendrite-free lithium metal anode. Moreover, the PVDF-INO separator not only enhances the affinity with electrolytes but also maintains stable lithium-ion flux, which is essential for reliable and safe battery operation. Consequently, it sustains operation over 750 h in a Li||Li symmetric battery configuration, with a low overpotential of just 28 mV. Additionally, full cells equipped with LiFePO4 cathodes and the PVDF-INO separator exhibit superior cycling performance, maintaining a capacity retention of 92.9% after 800 cycles at 1 C.

The electrolyte solvation structure rich in AGGs (97.96\u2009%) enables remarkable CE of 99.71\u2009% (25\u2009\u00b0C) as well as high CE of 98.56\u2009% even at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C. Moreover, the lithium\u2010sulfur battery exhibits excellent performance in a wide temperature range (\u221220 to 50\u2009\u00b0C) ascribed to the modified interphase rich in LiF/LiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. Furthermore, the pouch cell delivers superior energy density of 344.4\u2005Wh\u2009kg<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> and maintains 80\u2009% capacity retention after 50\u2005cycles. The novel solvent design via molecule chemistry provides alternative strategy to adjust solvation structure and thus favors high\u2010energy density lithium metal batteries.</jats:p>"}

However, the fatal dendritic growth on the lithium metal surface, which occurs during repetitive cycling, acts as a significant barrier to commercially successful lithium metal battery application. Therefore, regulating the morphology of lithium plating in commercial carbonate-based electrolytes is a critical challenge for the stable operation of lithium metal batteries. Additionally, this leads to the formation of inhomogeneous lithium dendrites in carbonate-based electrolytes, manifesting as uneven current density and lithium-ion concentration gradients. The uneven current leads to inconsistent charging/discharging rates in the corresponding Ni-rich cathode, which in turn causes overpotentials and deteriorates cell safety, culminating in a reduction of capacity. this has been clarified through Kelvin probe force microscopy analysis to demonstrate an uneven state of charge distribution in the Ni-rich cathode.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this work, we propose a new strategy for high-performance lithium metal batteries, utilizing 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl-2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) as a co-solvent with carbonate electrolytes.

This resulted in more uniform Li deposition compared to conventional carbonate-based electrolytes, forming a dense and stable Li metal layer. Furthermore, by leveraging our control over stable lithium plating morphologies via TTE co-solvent system, we observed long-term cycling stability (capacity retention of 78% at 300 cycles) with the use of an ultra-thin Li layer (40 \u00b5m).

Lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON), functioning as an amorphous solid electrolyte, is extensively employed as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) owing to its remarkable stability and mechanical strength, which is beneficial for effectively mitigating dendrite growth. Nevertheless, the significant challenge arises from the volume changes in the Li metal anode during cycling, leading to the vulnerability of LiPON due to its high rigidity, which impedes the widespread use of LiPON.

Polymers containing nitrile groups exhibit strong adhesion to lithium metal, facilitating the formation of the stable interface layer. Regarding electronic conductivity, the fluoropolymers preserve a good insulating property, which diminished marginally in the presence of lithium, but that of PAN and PEO significantly reduces.

However, the irregular deposition on the lithium metal anode during the cycles may lead to the formation of lithium dendrites, adversely affecting the safety and performance of LMBs. Furthermore, concentration polarization can cause lithium depletion at the electrode-electrolyte interface, increasing overpotential and thereby accelerating dendrite growth. Single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SIPEs), in which the anion is immobilized, possess the ability to mitigate concentration polarization. Herein, we prepared a salt-in-SIPE (SiSIPE) by incorporating a salt additive (LiTFSI) into SIPEs. Spectroscopy analysis (FT-IR and Raman) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that NMA, a plasticizer that has crystallinity at 25 \u2103, can form a solvation structure with LiTFSI. The intermolecular interactions inhibit the SiSIPE from crystallizing even at -80 \u2103, ensure high ionic conductivity (7.0\u00d710<jats:sup>-4</jats:sup> S cm<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) at 25 \u2103, and lead to a high t<jats:sub>Li</jats:sub>\n                  <jats:sup>+</jats:sup> (0.67) comparable to that of the SIPE (0.71, 2.2\u00d710<jats:sup>-4</jats:sup> S cm<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> at 25\u2103). Additionally, while NMA is easily decomposed above 4.0 V, the interactions ensure that the SiSIPE possesses a wide electrochemical stability window up to 4.4 V. To suppress the decomposition of the electrolyte and achieve stable cycle performance at high voltage, the electrolyte's HOMO level should be lower than that of the cathode. The DFT calculation results showed that the HOMO level of the solvation structure was found to be lower than when NMA forms hydrogen bonds with each other, which implies that it can suppress the decomposition of NMA at high voltages. Additionally, since the solvation structure has a lower LUMO level than NMA, it is preferentially used for forming the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. As a result, as shown in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results, due to the salt additive, the SiSIPE forms a more stable SEI layer compared to the SIPE. This leads to improved cycle stability in both Li symmetric cell (0.1 mAh cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup>, 700 hours) and LiFePO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> full cell tests (1 C-rate, 400 cycles, 80% retention). The intermolecular design through the salt additive can not only effectively suppress lithium dendrites but also enhance stability at high voltages and improve the cycle performance of LMBs. These strategies could significantly provide a new perspective in achieving high stability and high-performance LMBs.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>"}

These modeling frameworks play a crucial role in enhancing our fundamental understanding of the transport and reaction mechanisms and guide experimentalists in developing safer and more efficient lithium metal anodes. In this work, using a simple two-dimensional model for the lithium metal battery, we aim to bring attention to the bulk convection in the liquid electrolytes induced by the movement of the lithium metal surface modeled as a moving boundary. The back-and-forth motion of the lithium metal surface during the plating and stripping of lithium introduces a weak fluid motion in the liquid electrolyte that should be incorporated in the model equations and corresponding boundary conditions (Figure 1). The results for the electrochemical signatures and morphology evolution thus obtained by solving a coupled fluid model are compared with the case where the velocity distribution in the liquid electrolyte is ignored. This work extends our previously reported perspective on the convective flux correction to rectify the mass conservation failures at moving boundaries in one-dimensional models to two dimensions. This careful implementation of the correct boundary conditions ensures the mass conservation of lithium in two-dimensional simulations for predicting the morphological evolution of lithium metal electrodes over cycles. These revised battery models with accurate mass and charge conservation are crucial for predicting the performance of the battery over cycles. Additionally, these relative fluxes at the moving and fixed boundaries are sometimes ignored by assuming a bulk concentration condition at the far end, especially at the cathode/separator interface. While it may not affect overpotential signatures at the anode, it leads to mass conservation issues with implications for the accuracy of cycling simulations. Thus, with the help of a two-dimensional electro-convection model, this study addresses the role of bulk convection in liquid electrolytes and the importance of ensuring mass conservation in lithium metal battery models.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>References:</jats:bold>\n                  <jats:list list-type=\"roman-lower\">\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>T.

However, the conventional Li-S cell construction with ether-based electrolyte, composed of 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,3-dioxalane (DOL), suffers from severe shuttle effect and lithium metal anode corrosion because of soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPS) intermediates. These deficiencies further lead to limited cell calendar life and impedes Li-S batteries from practical applications. Weakening the electrolyte solvation power towards lithium polysulfide by adding hydrofluoroethers (HFEs) has been intensively explored and considered as an effective strategy to suppress LiPS dissolution and improve the electrochemical stability of electrolyte against lithium anode. Nevertheless, excessive fluorination of the current HFE cosolvents simultaneously confines the dissolution and solvation towards lithium salt, which detrimentally limits the ionic conductivity and therefore the electrochemical performance of the electrolyte. Herein, with the aim of decoupling lithium salt and LiPS solubility, we developed a partially fluorinated glyme, 1,2-bis(2,2-difluoroethoxy) ethane (F4DEE) as a novel solvent in Li-S battery electrolyte. The targeted design of F4DEE molecular structure enables F4DEE itself a considerable lithium salt solubility (&gt; 6 M for LiTFSI) yet a confined LiPS solubility (&lt; 100 mM for Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>). By combining F4DEE with conventional solvent DOL, the resulted DOL/F4DEE electrolyte realizes an extraordinary balance between reasonable ionic conductivity and suppressed LiPS dissolution. Furthermore, DOL/F4DEE electrolyte can induce a fluorine-rich solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) on Li anode surface, which is proven to be sturdy and thus benefit Li stripping/plating stability under real Li-S cycling conditions. When tested in coin cell configuration at room temperature, the Li-S cell with DOL/F4DEE electrolyte delivers a high initial specific capacity of 1081 mAh g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> at 0.05 C and an extended lifetime of over 180 cycles before cell failure at 0.1 C.

Currently, most methods of constructing LiF SEI involve decomposing the lithium salt by the polar groups of the filler.

Therefore, during TFSI<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup> decomposition to the formation of LiF, TFSI<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup> can obtain sufficient charge, thereby promoting the break of C\u2212F and forming the LiF\u2010rich SEI.

Increasing the content of lithium fluoride (LiF) in SEI can help the uniform deposition of lithium and inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites, thus improving the cycle stability performance of lithium batteries. Currently, most methods of constructing LiF SEI involve decomposing the lithium salt by the polar groups of the filler. However, there is a lack of research reports on how to affect the SEI layer of Li\u2010ion batteries by increasing the charge transfer number. In this study, a porous organic polymer with \u201ccharge storage\u201d properties was prepared and doped into a polymer composite solid electrolyte to study the effect of sufficient charge transfer on the decomposition of lithium salts. The results show in contrast to porphyrins, the unique structure of POF allows for charge transfer between each individual porphyrin. Therefore, during TFSI<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup> decomposition to the formation of LiF, TFSI<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup> can obtain sufficient charge, thereby promoting the break of C\u2212F and forming the LiF\u2010rich SEI. Compared with single porphyrin (0.423\u2005e<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup>), POF provides 2.7\u2005times more charge transfer to LiTFSI (1.147\u2005e<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup>). The experimental results show that Li//Li symmetric batteries equipped with PEO\u2010POF can be operated stably for more than 2700\u2005h at 60\u2009\u00b0C.

Even when the PEO\u2010base is replaced with a PEG\u2010base and a PVDF\u2010base, the performance of the cell is still significantly improved.

Our focus lies in the comprehensive analysis of three distinct categories of fluorinated additives, each differing in their degree of fluorination. The computations reveal that fluorination plays a significant role in determining both the ionic conductivity and the formation of the solid\u2013electrolyte interphase (SEI) film. Specifically, heightened fluorination enhances the oxidative stability of the system but diminishes the strength of solvent binding, resulting in the formation of larger salt/anion clusters and a decrease in ionic conductivity. Conversely, increased fluorination facilitates the interaction between fluorinated additives and the lithium metal surface, thereby aiding in the formation of a stable SEI film characterized by an abundance of inorganic LiF components. This is important as it serves to suppress dendrite growth and mitigate interface side reactions. Considering the combined influences of ionic conductivity and film formation, 1FP is suggested as the optimal candidate for pyridine\u2010based additive systems, with FEC preferred for cyclic ester\u2010based additive systems and BC for chain ester\u2010based additive systems.

Moreover, the benefits of solid-state electrolytes are emerging to achieve high energy density. However, the technology of solid-state electrolytes needs to mature further. In the present state, a gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) could act as a bridge between liquid (LEs) and solid-state electrolytes (SSEs). GPEs under certain conditions can offer the advantages of both LEs and SSEs. Firstly, GPEs should be feasible to create a gel structure with minimal polymer content to ensure high ionic conductivity. Ideally, they should also exhibit a high lithium ion transference number. Secondly, GPEs should ensure safety from the risk of fire. It is essential not only to prioritize the non-flammability of polymer matrix but also to suppress the ignition of the LEs contained within GPEs. Lastly, in the current manufacturing process, the injection of liquid-state GPEs without additional steps should be possible. Also, in-situ gelation is necessary to mitigate interfacial problems. The non-flammable GPEs developed in the previous study satisfied above three conditions but had the disadvantage of long gelation time about one day at 60 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C. The gelation reaction was hindered by the bulky size of the functional groups substituted to enhance the non-flammability. Therefore, the amount of substituted functional groups was inevitably limited.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this study, fully substituted polymers were used to form the GPEs rapidly at room temperature or low temperatures (45 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C) with the addition of a lithium salts-anion-like initiator. The strong CN bonds were allowed to form carbocation due to easily ionized initiators. As a result, generated highly conjugated C=N-C bond great help to the formation of non-flammable polymer matrix compared with conjugated C=N-C bond from LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>. Furthermore, thermal degradation of the batteries was minimized because of rapid gelation at room temperature or lukewarm temperature. As the GPEs can undergo gelation without LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>, which was employed as an initiator in the previous method, stable operation at 60 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C or higher became possible. In the previous method, the decomposition of LipF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> into hydrogen fluoride at 60 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C resulted in a side reaction at the interphase between the electrolyte and the electrode. However, with the use of an initiator consisting of two anions instead of LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>, a stable lithium salt could be employed at high temperatures, ensuring stable operation. Moreover, the absence of hydroxyl groups enables the operation of a lithium metal battery that was previously inoperable when using PVA-CN. Due to the highly potent oxidizing power of the initiator, the gelation could rapidly progress even within a bulky substitute structure. Therefore, bulky flame-retardant structures could be fully incorporated into the polymer instead of the hydroxyl group (OH). Consequently, the side reaction of OH was eliminated. Specifically, the maximized presence of the fluorine functional group with radical scavenging ability ensured enhanced non-flammability of the entire electrolyte compared to previous studies.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In summary, the addition of the initiator enabled rapid gelation with minimal energy consumption, facilitating the development of a lithium metal battery suitable for high-temperature operation. Furthermore, complete substitution of the functional group enhanced various functions and the flame retardancy of the electrolyte.    </jats:p>"}

One method to achieve dendrite-free electrodeposition of Li involves the addition of a small amount of water to an electrolyte containing LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>, leading to the formation of HF through hydrolysis. During electrodeposition, LiF precipitates along with lithium, resulting in the formation of columnar lithium, which is known to inhibit dendrite formation [1]. In this study, therefore, we investigated the influence of solvent properties on the columnar structure of lithium by adding a small amount of water to electrolytes containing LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> in three different solvents with varying properties, comparing the mass changes on the electrode surface and the composition of the deposits during lithium electrodeposition.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Experiment: Three solvents (pure dimethyl carbonate (DMC), a mixture of ethyl carbonate (EC) and DMC (v/v = 1:1), and a mixture of EC and diethyl carbonate (DEC) (wt/wt = 1:1)) were used for the experiments after adding 1 M LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> and approximately 50 ppm water, ensuring sufficient progress of hydrolysis. Copper foil or copper-coated quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) electrodes were employed as the working electrode, and lithium foil was used as the counter electrode. Lithium electrodeposition was conducted at a constant current density of -0.5 mA cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> for 2 hours, during which the mass changes and impedance variations were monitored using QCM and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), respectively. Additionally, composition analysis of the deposited lithium after electrodeposition was performed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results and Discussion: The rate of hydrolysis of LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> by the added water varied significantly depending on the solvent, with durations of 2 days for DMC alone, 8 days for EC/DMC, and 20 days for EC/DEC. This difference is seemed to be due to variations in the dissociation of LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>. When a current was passed through the copper electrode, a plateau region of cell voltage due to HF reduction was maintained for 10 to 20 seconds around 2 V, followed by a decrease in voltage and a constant voltage of ca. -0.2 V, indicating the onset of lithium deposition. The ratio of mass increase during lithium deposition (mass per electron; MPE) was in the reverse order of the rate of hydrolysis, with EC/DEC &gt; EC/DMC &gt; DMC. Additionally, the resonant resistance increased significantly in the order of DMC &gt; EC/DMC &gt; EC/DEC. Based on the mass changes and the morphology of the deposition mentioned later, it is highly probable that an increase in viscosity and density of the electrolyte due to side reactions, or an increase in surface area due to dendrite formation, occurred. In EC/DEC and EC/DMC, a characteristic blue-colored precipitate indicative of columnar lithium structures was observed, while in DMC, it was gray, showing lithium dendrite. XPS analysis revealed that LiF was dominant on the surface of the deposited lithium in all electrolytes, but there were significant differences in the amount of surface carbon, with EC/DEC &gt; EC/DMC &gt; EC/DEC. These results suggest that differences in EC content lead to variations in the dissociation and viscosity of the electrolyte, which in turn affect the morphology of the deposited lithium.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] R.

However, the underlying mechanism still remains under debate, due in part to a lack of in situ atomic-level observations of the dendrite penetration process. Here, we employ large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to reproduce the dynamic process of dendrite nucleation and penetration. Our findings reveal that dynamically generated lithium depositions lead to a continuous accumulation of internal stress, culminating in fracture of the solid electrolyte at dendrite tips. We demonstrate that the classical Griffith theory remains effective in assessing this fracture mode, but it is necessary to consider the electrochemical impact of local lithium ion concentration on the fracture toughness. Additionally, in polycrystalline solid electrolytes, we observe that initial defects or dendrite nuclei within grains typically deflect towards and propagate along grain boundaries. Simulations and experimental evidence both identify that dendrite induced fractures at grain boundaries exhibit a mixed Mode I and Mode II pattern, contingent on their fracture toughness and the angle between dendrites and grain boundaries. These insights deepen our understanding of dendrite penetration mechanisms and may offer valuable guidance for improving the performance of solid electrolytes.</p>"}

As a conversion-type battery, the lithium\u2013sulfur battery could completely convert its chemical energy to electrical energy and would not be limited by the structural constraint of the electrode materials, resulting in higher electrochemical utilization, a higher theoretical capacity, and a higher energy density than general lithium-ion batteries. The theoretical capacity and theoretical energy density of lithium\u2013sulfur batteries reach 1675 mAh g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> and 2600 Wh kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>, respectively.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> During the charging and discharging processes, lithium\u2013sulfur batteries undergo a series of complex electrochemical reactions. During the discharging process, the solid-state sulfur (S<jats:sub>8</jats:sub>) of the cathode reacts with lithium ions and then transforms to liquid-state polysulfides, and solid-state lithium sulfide (Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S) in sequence. While during the charging process, solid-state Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S first transforms to liquid-state polysulfides and then transforms to solid-state S<jats:sub>8</jats:sub> with the reversible return of lithium ions to the metallic lithium anode. Although lithium\u2013sulfur batteries feature so many advantages, lithium\u2013sulfur batteries could not reach the criteria for commercialization because of some unsolved problems, such as the low sulfur loading, the high electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio, the low conductivity of the cathode, and the irreversible polysulfide diffusion. Among them, the irreversible polysulfide diffusion causes the continuous capacity decay of lithium\u2013sulfur batteries. Liquid-state polysulfides, which are the intermediate products during the cycling process, have a high solubility in the common liquid-state electrolyte of lithium\u2013sulfur batteries. Thus, it is easy for polysulfides to diffuse to the anode with liquid electrolyte during cycling, which results in the deposition of non-conductive sulfides on the surfaces of electrodes. Moreover, it also leads to the irreversible loss of the active material, the rapid decay of capacity, and the reduction of cycle life.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> In this study, electrospinning technology is utilized to fabricate three kinds of membranes which consist of polyacrylonitrile (PAN), poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP), and PAN/PVDF-HFP composite, acting as separator/gel electrolyte membranes in lithium\u2013sulfur cells. PAN features high thermal stability, proper morphology for electrolyte absorption, and the mitigation of polysulfide diffusion due to the cyanide functional group (\u2212C\u2261N) on its molecular chains. As a result, PAN membranes are utilized as separators in lithium\u2013sulfur cells. PVDF-HFP, which forms as a gel in the common ether liquid electrolyte for lithium\u2013sulfur batteries, could stabilize lithium-ions transfer and capture the liquid electrolyte. Thus, PVDF-HFP membranes act as gel electrolyte membranes in lithium\u2013sulfur cells. With a high sulfur loading of 4.2 mg cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup>, the cell with PAN separator achieved a discharge capacity of 980 mAh g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> and maintained a high capacity of 680 mAh g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> at C/10 rate after 100 cycles, showing a great ability to inhibit polysulfide diffusion. The cell with PVDF-HFP gel electrolyte achieved a high discharge capacity of 1190 mAh g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> and demonstrated a long cycle life of 900 hours at lithium//lithium symmetrical cell, showing that PVDF-HFP gel electrolyte has a great ability to stabilize electrode surfaces and smooth the lithium-ions conduction. Therefore, a triple-layered sandwiched structural PVDF-HFP/PAN/PVDF-HFP (PH/P/PH) gel electrolyte membrane which consists of double layers of PVDF-HFP and a single layer of PAN in the middle is fabricated to maintain both the mitigation of polysulfide diffusion of PAN and smooth lithium-ion conducting channels of PVDF-HFP. The cell with this PH/P/PH composited gel electrolyte demonstrated a high discharge capacity of 1370 mAh g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>, a high areal capacity of 5.75 mAh cm<jats:sup>-</jats:sup>\n                  <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, a high energy density of 12.08 mWh kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>, and a long cycle life of over 2000 hours at lithium//lithium symmetrical cell.

To adopt the advantages of these two novel battery technologies, we report an integrated design of the lithium\u2013sulfur electrochemical cell with the solid-state electrolyte as a lithium\u2013sulfur solid-state electrolyte cell. The lithium\u2013sulfur electrochemical cell employs a high-sulfur-loading polysulfide cathode to achieve high energy density and to form a smooth ion-transfer interface between the catholyte and the solid-state electrolyte. On the other hand, the solid-state electrolyte provides excellent stability and safety to the cells by stabilizing the polysulfide cathode and protecting the lithium anode.

However, viable lithium anode solid-state batteries are yet to be realized [1]. As a solid-state battery anode, lithium metal is expensive, highly reactive, and prone to dendritic short-circuiting, making it difficult to incorporate into manufacturing systems and unreliable as an anode [9]. Owing to this, alternative solid-state battery anode materials have been proposed. Chief among these are alloy anode materials, such as silicon, tin, and aluminum, which electrochemically alloy and de-alloy with lithium during charge and discharge of the battery, respectively [10]. These materials experience difficulties in conventional liquid electrolyte lithium-ion batteries due to their large volumetric change during electrochemical cycling that constantly exposes new surface area to the highly reactive liquid electrolyte; this consumes the anode material and quickly degrades capacity [11]. With a solid-state electrolyte, however, this effect is mitigated because the solid electrolyte does not flow to contact new surfaces, resulting in less SEI formation [12]. Despite recent performance advancements with alloy anode materials in solid-state batteries [12,13], there is not yet a fundamental understanding of their dynamic evolution and electro-chemo-mechanical behavior in these systems. Most efforts to characterize this behavior have been conducted with <jats:italic>ex situ</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>postmortem</jats:italic> imaging techniques that can artificially damage the anode and its interface with the solid electrolyte [12,13].</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Here, we use <jats:italic>operando</jats:italic> synchrotron XCT to non-destructively investigate the morphological evolution of silicon-based anodes in solid-state batteries during electrochemical cycling.

Utilizing the excellent spatial and temporal resolution of synchrotron XCT, we reveal the dynamic microstructural evolution of silicon-based electrodes during discharge and charge. We observe the formation of cracks within the silicon anode, as well as identifying key fracture mechanisms that govern impedance evolution. Our results provide new understanding of degradation in silicon anode solid-state batteries and give insight into materials design strategies for mitigating degradation.

This leads to parasitic reactions between the polysulfides and the anode, causing rapid cell degradation from active material loss, degradation of the anode solid electrolyte interface (SEI), and subsequent rapid dendrite formation. The shuttle effect is a primary mechanism of cell failure, and as such, most research into Li-S focuses on its mitigation. Current methods of characterizing the shuttle effect provide limited detail or are overly time consuming, so more robust characterization methods are required to further understand the distribution, dynamics, and degree of polysulfide transport.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Here, the newly established Optical Fluorescence Microscopy (OFM) technique, for visualising the spatial distribution of polysulfides within the Li-S electrolyte and through sufficiently large cathode pores during <jats:italic>operando</jats:italic> cycling, is utilised for facile assessment of the efficacy of a variety of additives to Li-S batteries in reducing the polysulfide shuttle effect. Using a polysulfide sensitive fluorescent dye, established to be inert to both the components of a Li-S battery and the additives, the intermediate polysulfides formed throughout cycling can be made to fluoresce, and thus directly visualised. The correlation between fluorescence intensity and polysulfide concentration is also linear when below the linear concentration range of the dye, allowing for polysulfide concentration to be spatially quantified through use of a calibration curve. This enables direct observation of the kinetics of sulfur dissolution and the subsequent diffusion towards the anode and dendrite formation, and thus measurement of the efficacy of steps taken to prevent this.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The effects of various additives are elucidated using this method \u2013 including the standard LiNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> additive in sacrificially protecting the lithium anode through SEI formation, as well as novel fibroin-based additives trapping polysulfides within the cathode. Further, the total lack of solubilised intermediate polysulfides within the electrolyte potentially granted by a quasi-solid-state Li-S morphology is assessed through OFM. As is the impact of catalytic additives on the kinetics of the Li-S conversion mechanism, through reduction in the time polysulfides spend in the solubilised state. With OFM, one can directly and conveniently assess the real-time spatial distribution, dynamics, and degree of polysulfide transport in a cycling Li-S cell far faster and significantly easier then would be possible with other methods, and with a very robust dataset. OFM is thus an ideal platform for the development of polysulfide shuttle mitigation strategies, allowing rapid iteration of mitigation methods such as new additives or cathode morphologies. It has the potential for a widespread impact in the field of Li-S batteries, in both industry and academia, through collaboration with and usage by other researchers developing shuttle mitigation techniques.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>"}

Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries feature promising high energy density and sustainability, but are hindered by a short cycle life under lean lithium and electrolyte conditions. A critical hurdle for Li-S batteries is the selection of an optimal electrolyte solution, crucial for controlling effective polysulfide electrochemical reactions. The conventional ether- based Li-S electrolyte, consisting of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium nitrate (LiNO3), frequently suffers from LiNO3 depletion in high-energy-density applications. To address the capacity decay in Li-S batteries caused by LiNO3 depletion, this investigation introduces 2-nitrophenol lithium (NPL) as an alternative. By incorporating 25 1 mM NPL and 1 M LiTFSI in a 1,3-dioxolane/1,2-dimethoxyethane (DOL/DME) solvent, NPL mediates polysulfide oxidation during charging and prevents polysulfide corrosion, therefore improving Li retention and plating behavior. This results in Li-S batteries with NPL achieving 310 cycles, significantly surpassing the 75 cycles observed with traditional LiNO3-containing electrolytes using lean lithium anode. Pouch cells incorporating NPL exhibit stable cycling over 80 cycles, maintaining 75% of their capacity. The molecular structure of NPL prevents decomposition and facilitates interaction with polysulfides to minimize corrosion, positioning it as a strong substitute for LiNO3. This highlights NPL as a promising solution for extending the lifespan of Li-S batteries.</jats:p>"}

Solid-state electrolytes have gained attention due to their advantages such as compactness, higher energy density, and enhanced safety. This study investigates dendrite growth in batteries via phase field simulations utilizing a grand potential-based phase field model. The simulations are executed using the MOOSE (Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment) framework, a Finite Element Method (FEM) based solver known for its modular approach and proficiency in handling complex multi-physics problems.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Initially, the study considers a pure lithium anode and a 1M LiPF6 electrolyte for the liquid case. To explore the benefits of solid electrolytes, a fictitious solid electrolyte with transport properties similar to the liquid electrolyte but having different mechanical properties is considered. The mechanical impact resulting from the volume changes due to lithium deposition is not accounted for in the liquid electrolyte model. However, the solid electrolyte model addresses this by modifying the Butler-Volmer kinetics and incorporating the influence of stresses on the localized lithium deposition. Sensitivity analysis is performed for various parameters in both the liquid and solid electrolytes. The results indicate that dendrite growth is reduced with decreased applied over-potential and interfacial energies. For solid electrolytes, an additional parameter, increased Young\u2019s modulus, contributes to reduced dendrite growth.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> The evaluation of dendrite growth involves quantifying surface roughness using the root mean square (RMS) approach. The elasticity modulus significantly influences dendrite formation, with higher values in materials like LLZO, and glass Li3PS4 exhibiting lower dendrite growth, while lower values in polymer-based materials like P(VDF-HFP) and PVDF/CAB/PE exhibit higher dendrite growth. The solid electrolyte acts as a crucial mechanical barrier, influencing the dendrite tip growth rate and ensuring uniform electrodeposition throughout the dendritic structure. Furthermore, the work investigates the impact of the cathode on dendrite growth. The contraction of the cathode provides additional space for dendrites to move, leading to reduced compressive stresses and increased dendrite growth. Conversely, higher compressive stresses suppress dendrite growth.    </jats:p>"}

Analogous improvement in energy is possible with sodium metal batteries (NMBs) and with potassium metal batteries (KMBs), where existing ion insertion anodes can be replaced by plating/stripping metal. However, in all three cases safety and performance are compromised by an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that consumes metal ions and electrolyte, and ultimately leads to dendrites. This presentation provides a series of case studies derived from the group's LMB, NMB and KMB liquid and solid-state research on the microstructural design principles that provide for long-term cycling and fast-charge stability of metal anodes. The approaches may be categorized as the following: a) design of plating/stripping supports and templates with tuned geometry and functionality; b) design of secondary interlayers placed between the metal anode and the separator; and c) design of multifunctional hybrid separators to replace the conventional polymer separators employed with LIBs. It is demonstrated that despite appearing distinct, the efficacy of each in enabling electrochemical stability originates from three fundamental features that are directly interrelated. The wetting behavior of the electrolyte on the anode must be optimized, the wetting/stripping behavior of the metal anode on the current collector must be controlled, and a geometrically and chemically modified SEI must be established. Simultaneously achieving all three leads to stable plating/stripping, while missing even one leads to rapid dendrite growth. Cryogenic FIB cross sections and cryo-TEM are combined to yield new insight regarding film wetting behavior and early dendrite formation in optimized versus baseline specimens, analyzing growth in several representative electrolytes.    </jats:p>"}

However, the lithium metal anode has been known to exhibit poor cycle performance or give rise to short circuits due to the dendritic or whisker-like morphology of lithium formed during deposition and dissolution. Analysis of the morphology of lithium deposits, especially the cross-section, is considered to be important for contributing to research on improving the charge-discharge ability of lithium metal anode. The formation of a uniform and highly Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the lithium metal surface leading to dense and low porosity lithium deposits and a reversible deposition-dissolution reaction of lithium is a significant challenge. It has been suggested that the bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide (FSA<jats:sup>\u2013</jats:sup>)-derived SEI in ionic liquid (IL) electrolyte containing a high concentration of LiFSA can improve cycle performance and suppress dendritic growth [1,2]. We have reported the cycle performance of lithium and the formation of a SEI for electrolytes comprised of LiFSA in MOEMPFSA (MOEMP<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>: 1-methyl-1-methoxyethylpyrrolidinium) or BMPFSA (BMP<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>: 1-methyl-1-butylpyrrolidinium) [3]. The resistance of the SEI in LiFSA-MOEMPFSA (1:1 molar ratio) was lower than that in LiFSA-BMPFSA (1:1 molar ratio), and the deposition and dissolution performance of a lithium metal anode was improved in LiFSA-MOEMPFSA compared to LiFSA-BMPFSA. This is thought to be due to the variation in SEI composition with IL cation structure. Previous studies have demonstrated the cycle performance at a capacity of 1 or 4 mAh cm<jats:sup>\u20132 </jats:sup>[3,4] for lithium metal. However, these values are rather low when considering the proposed application as a negative electrode material for next-generation batteries, and it is essential to study a larger capacity. In the present study, the morphological changes of Li during deposition and dissolution cycle at 10 mAh cm<jats:sup>\u20132</jats:sup> and the relationship between cycle performance and the morphology of deposited Li was investigated.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> The electrolytes were prepared by mixing MOEMPFSA or BMPFSA and LiFSA at 50.0-50.0 mol%. The water contents in the ionic liquid electrolytes were less than 50 ppm, as determined by Karl Fischer titration. The preparation of 10 mAh cm<jats:sup>\u20132 </jats:sup>deposited Li on Cu was conducted using a Cu|Li planar electrode cell (laminate-like) at 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mA cm<jats:sup>\u20132</jats:sup>. Celgard 3501 was used as the separator. The cross-sections of the deposited lithium on Cu were revealed by processing with Ar ion milling at \u201380 \u00b0C. The observation of the cross-section of deposited lithium on Cu was carried out with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and without exposure to air.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> The SEM images of the cross-sections of a 10 mAh cm<jats:sup>\u20132</jats:sup> lithium deposit on Cu at 0.1 or 0.5 mA cm<jats:sup>\u20132 </jats:sup>in LiFSA-MOEMPFSA reveal a denser and lower porosity than that at 1.0 mA cm<jats:sup>\u20132</jats:sup>. It is suggested that columnar growth of lithium was observed due to particle growth rather than nucleation at lower current density. The morphology of the 10 mAh cm<jats:sup>\u20132</jats:sup> lithium deposits on Cu at 0.5 mA cm<jats:sup>\u20132 </jats:sup>in LiFSA-MOEMPFSA was denser than that in LiFSA-BMPFSA. This is thought to be due to the differences in the resistance of the SEI derived from MOEMPFSA and BMPFSA. The denser and lower porosity deposited lithium is considered to be promising for operation at as high a capacity as 10 mAh cm<jats:sup>\u20132</jats:sup>, and is expected to contribute to the improvement of the reversibility of the lithium anode with suppressing dendritic growth.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Acknowledgments</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This study was supported by the Green Technologies of Excellence (GteX, JPMJGX23S0) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).

However, there are several challenging issues in order to realize the use of this type of next generation battery. First, the lithium metal anode has an intrinsic safety issue, dendrite growth that can result in internal short circuit failure. Second, the sulfur cathode is a very insulating material; therefore, sulfur-based cathodes need a large amount of conducting additives, resulting in the decrease in the practically available gravimetric capacity per the unit mass of cathode composite. Third, lithium polysulfides, reduced (discharged) forms of sulfur, dissolve into an electrolyte solution, resulting in capacity fading. For realistic battery applications, these issues from both the anode and the cathode need to be solved or mitigated. To this end, we integrate three practically possible solutions: (1) manufacture-friendly pre-lithiation of anode or cathode materials, (2) practically optimal choice of conducting agent and of the method for sulfur-conductive-agent integration, and (3) stabilization of discharged forms of the cathode. In addition, we are tackling with a well-known issue among lithium sulfur battery researchers, low mass-loading of sulfur: sulfur-based cathode, 2 mg/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>; LiCoO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-based cathode, 20 mg/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, graphite-based anode, 10 mg/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>.

Constructing stable and efficient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is among the most effective strategies to inhibit the dendrite growth and thus to achieve a superior cycling performance. In this review, the mechanisms of SEI formation and models of SEI structure are briefly summarized. The analysis methods to probe the surface chemistry, surface morphology, electrochemical property, dynamic characteristics of SEI layer are emphasized. The critical factors affecting the SEI formation, such as electrolyte component, temperature, current density, are comprehensively debated.

For lithium metal anodes, the problem of dendrite formation caused by inhomogeneous lithium plating has been known for decades but in spite of intensive research no viable solutions have been found yet, thus rendering lithium metal anodes impractical for commercial cells.<jats:sup>[1]</jats:sup> Graphite, which has been widely used instead, can reversibly intercalate/deintercalate lithium ions for hundreds of cycles. Still, charging at harsh conditions, such as low temperature or high C-rate, can also trigger the formation of lithium dendrites on graphite anodes.<jats:sup>[2]</jats:sup> Most studies on lithium plating and dendrite formation are based on microscopic techniques. At the current stage, there are only very few analytical techniques available that give quantitative or semi-quantitative information about the occurrence of micro-structured lithium during cell cycling under <jats:italic>in-operando</jats:italic> conditions, one example being <jats:italic>in-operando </jats:italic>NMR spectroscopy which has been introduced by Clare Grey and coworkers.<jats:sup>[3]</jats:sup>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this work we propose to use <jats:italic>in-operando</jats:italic>electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy as a new analytical technique for the time resolved and quantitative determination of lithium microstructures both on lithium metal and graphite anodes.

Lithium-ion battery represents the most promising candidate due to its high energy density, conventionally of about 180 Wh kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> that may assure a driving range of 150 km by single charge, i.e. acceptable value, however far from that granted by the conventional combustion engine vehicles. The lithium oxygen system, can theoretically allow to obtain an energy density of 1000 Wh kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>, i.e. a value that may increase the driving range by single charge [3]. The applicability of the lithium air batteries is limited by several drawbacks, such as the poor electrolyte stability, the short cycle life and the low energy efficiency due to high charge-discharge polarization [4]. A deep knowledge of the lithium-oxygen reaction mechanism [5] and the identification of a stable electrolyte [6] play important role fundamental in allowing the practical application of the system. Furthermore, the safety concerns associated to the reactivity of the lithium metal anode are still hindering the application of the lithium-oxygen battery [7]. We report a Li/O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> cell exploiting an ionic liquid(IL)-based, N-Methyl-N-Butyl-Pyrrolidinium Bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-Imide Lithium bis-(trifluormethanesulfonyl)-imide, Pyr<jats:sub>14</jats:sub>TFSI-LiTFSI electrolyte. The use of non-flammable IL-based electrolyte stable up to a 300-400 \u00b0C resulted in an improved safety level of the battery [8].\u00a0 In addition, the ionic-liquid electrolyte allows a fast kinetics of the lithium oxygen electrochemical process, thus lead to an high energy efficiency. The results here obtained, and reported in summary in the figure evidence low cell polarization, most likely due to the reduced particle size of the discharged products [9]. The replacement of the reactive lithium metal by an alternative, safe anode material may be required to further enhance the lithium oxygen cell characteristics [10]. Herein, we employed an alternative, nanostructured tin-carbon composite instead of lithium metal, in lithium ion-oxygen cell characterized in terms of electrochemical properties, focusing particular attention to the study of the oxygen cross-over process. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] B.

The high risk of oil spill due to unexpected failures of undersea facilities urges the deployment of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) for frequent and thorough inspections in these extreme environments that humans cannot easily access. To meet the long endurance and occasionally high power requirements of the AUV, we propose a lithium-bromine/oxygen fuel cell with a protected lithium metal anode to provide high specific energy at either low-power mode with seawater (oxygen) or high-power mode with bromine catholytes. The proof-of-concept fuel cell with a flat catalyst-free graphite electrode can discharge at 3mW/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> with seawater, and 9mW/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> with dilute bromine catholytes. The fuel cell can also be recharged with LiBr catholytes efficiently to recover the lithium metal anode. Scanning electron microscopy images reveal that both the organic electrolye and the bromine electrolyte corrode the solid electrolyte plate quickly, leading to nanoporous pathways that can percolate through the plate,\u00a0thus limiting the cell performance and lifetime. With improved solid electrolytes or membraneless flow designs, the dual-mode lithium-bromine/oxygen system could enable not only AUV but also land-based electric vehicles, by providing a critical high-power mode to high-energy-density (but otherwise low-power) lithium-air batteries.</jats:p>"}

Even though the achievable cell voltage in this kind of cells is about 4.6 V, the specific energy is still quite low compared to common lithium-ion batteries. The reason for this is a fundamental difference from conventional lithium-ion batteries, since not only the electrodes, but also the electrolyte acts as active material. During charging, lithium cations are reduced and deposited at a metallic lithium anode, while the anions are intercalated into graphite. During discharging, anions and cations are released back into the electrolyte (see figure 1).[1] Therefore the electrolyte acts as ion source, and the concentration hereby limits the energy density. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>As the cell voltage of \u201cdual-ion cells\u201d is very high the electrolyte needs to have a wide electrochemical window.

This fact gives the possibility to investigate fundamental processes during charging and discharging by measuring the electrolyte resistance.

Introduction </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Recently lithium metal anode has been widely studied for next-generation high energy density rechargeable batteries as the power source of electric vehicles and stationary storage of the electricity from solar and winds power stations [1]. Lithium metal is a promising anode material for the high energy density rechargeable batteries, because of its highest specific capacity (3861 mAh\u00b7g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) and lowest negative electrode potential (-3.04 V versus standard hydrogen electrode). The binary electrolytes with M<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> cations and X<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> anions are prone to initiate lithium dendrite formation when the operating current density exceeds its limiting diffusion current density (J*) due to the quick depletion of X<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> and the accompanying instability of interface [2]. Solvent-in-salt (or salt-concentrated) electrolytes usually possess high lithium ion transference number, high lithium salt concentration and thus high J*, which shed new light on the suppression of lithium dendrite at high current densities [3]. Herein, we present a solvate ionic liquid (SIL) of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (G4) as a novel electrolyte to study lithium dendrite in the high current density regime. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>2. Experimental </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>G4 (Kishida Chemical, Japan) and LiFSI (Central Glass, Japan) were mixed in different molar ratios in an Ar-filled glovebox. Prior to usage, G4 was dehydrated by activated 3\u00c5 molecular sieves until the residual moisture was controlled below 10 ppm. As-received LiFSI was dried at 40 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C for 24 h in a vacuum oven. The mixtures of LiFSI-xG4 were stirred for 24 h at room temperature and the as-prepared homogenous electrolytes were stored and handled in the glovebox, where x is the molar ratio of G4 to LiFSI. The final residual moisture in all mixtures was below 20 ppm. Surface morphology of the deposited Li cathode was investigated by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). Specimens were mounted onto the homemade SEM holders in a glove box and transferred into the SEM instrument to avoid the contamination from water in air. The CR2032 coin-type cell of Li/LIFSI-xG4/Li with a glass fiber separator (Whatman GF/B) was employed to examine the Li electrode performance in LiFSI-xG4. All the cell parts were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C for 24 h prior to usage. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>3. Results and Discussion </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Raman measurements revealed that the solvent of G4 was completely bound to lithium cations to form a solvate ionic liquid (SIL) for x=1 and 2 in the as-prepared mixtures of LiFSI-xG4. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy measurements of lithium electrode surface indicated G4 should participate in and control the generation of the surface film onto lithium metal. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The morphology of lithium electrodeposits in LiFSI-2G4 was revealed to be flat homogenous adjoining proto-islands as shown in Fig. 1, which may promote a two-dimensional layer-by-layer lithium deposition mode. The solvated lithium ions of (2G4)Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> in the bulk electrolyte deposit onto these proto-islands by interaction of G4 as a surfactant, resulting in enhancement of the nucleation density and reduce the magnitude of the islands edge barrier [4]. The high adatoms diffusivity could also be realized at 60 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C by virtue of elevated temperature and moderate viscosity. As long as the size of growing island is greater than the separation between two-dimensional nuclei, the layer-by-layer growth prevails in the subsequent deposition [5]. A symmetrical Li/LiFSI-2G4/Li cell showed no short-circuit for 41.2 h till the capacity of used lithium anode at 1 mA\u00b7cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> and 60 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C. Lithium anode can deliver a high specific areal capacity of 12 mAh\u00b7cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> for 40 cycles at 6 mA\u00b7cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> and 60 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C in LiFSI-2G4. Further, we demonstrated that LiFSI-2G4 as the anolyte allows the practical cycleability of high energy density aqueous lithium-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> cell and confirmed that LiFSI-2G4 is a highly promising electrolyte for lithium electrode. Details of these results will be presented in this meeting. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Acknowledgements </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This study was supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) under the \u201cAdvanced Low Carbon Technology Research and Development Program\u201d.

This causes a great interest on these type of batteries. However, the performance of Li-air batteries is affected by many factors such as type of catalysts and electrolyte composition. The stability of electrolytes is a significant limitation for cycle life performance in Li-air batteries. In recent years, most efforts have focused on the development of stable electrolytes to improve cycle life and capacity of rechargeable Li-air batteries. Therefore, stability of the polymer composite electrolytes against the reduced oxygen species generated during the discharge process was investigated. Since Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is generated at the cathode surface during cycling, an investigation of the thermal stability, conductivity and resistance of electrolytes with Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was conducted. The other challenge of the stability of Li-air batteries is degradation of lithium anode. For this reason, great efforts of this study focused on improving lifetime and recycleability through, obtaining stable electrolyte with polymeric and inorganic additives. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>For this aim, 1 M LiPF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> and LiBF<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> salts dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) aprotic solvent and selected amount of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyethylene oxide (PEO), which is mostly used as binders for air electrodes in Li-air batteries and Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> nanoparticles added into the electrolyte to improve thermal stability, provide highly reversible Li-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> reaction during charging/discharging and prevent clogging of the porous structure of the cathode. In order to investigate electrochemical performance of the produced nanocomposite electrolytes, ECC-Air test cell was assembled in Ar-filled glove box. The lithium foil was used as anode, Sigracet 24BC gas diffusion layer (GDL) was used as the cathode and prepared nanocomposite solutions were used as the electrolyte. The anode and cathode was separated with a glass fiber separator. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and derivative thermagravimetry (TG) measurements were used for thermal stability studies for the electrolytes. The cells were cyclically tested using 0.1 mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> current density over a voltage range of 2.15\u20134.1 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements was carried out to investigate the effect of the PVDF, PeO and Al2O3 additives on the resistivity of the electrolyte. After the electrochemical cycling test, the surface of the cathode (GDL) was characterized using environmental scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction patterns and Raman spectroscopy to investigate deposited lithium compounds such as LiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>CO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> on the cathode during cycling test.</jats:p>"}
